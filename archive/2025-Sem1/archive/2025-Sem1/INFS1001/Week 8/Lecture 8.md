**Two SDLC Methods (Waterfall & Agile):**

- **Waterfall:** A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, etc.) must be completed before the next begins.
- **Agile:** An iterative and incremental approach that emphasises flexibility, collaboration, and frequent delivery of working software in cycles.
- Differ fundamentally in their structure: Waterfall is rigid and predictive, while Agile is flexible and adaptive.
