#### Negative oil future price (2020)
What happens if you leave your contract until maturity.
During to Covid, there was an oil price war between Russia and Saudia, meaning there was an oversupply.
- The whole industry was running out of storage space to store their crude oil.
- They bought so much oil because it was so cheap they didn't have room
- Because of Covid, people can't use the oil.
- As the delivery date for the crude oil grew near, the long position (they agreed to buy the crude oil), they realised they won't have any space to store the oil.
- They start to sell their oil or try to sell out their position.
- This caused the price to crash to -35 for crude oil.
- The long position basically says I don't want the crude oil to the short position as they can't find anywhere to store it.

#### Hedging
Basic principles of hedging
- Hold (or expected to hold) a position in an asset.
- Don't want to be exposed to movements in asset price
- Hedge to eliminate (or reduce) the exposure in asset price
- Hedge to eliminate (or reduce) the exposure to price movements
- Enter a derivatives position that provides a payoff which offsets the price movements in the exposed underlying asset.
**Strategy**
- Identify the risk/exposure in the asset
- Enter a derivatives position that makes money when this unfavourable scenario occurs 

**Example**
- You are a manager of a construction company, you construct roads and highways
- You just signed a contract to construct a road in Sydney
	- Assume we are at the beginning of 2019 now.
	- The road was due to be completed in December 2019.
	- Towards the end of the construction process, you need to purchase about 500 tones of bitumen to complete the road construction.
	- The current (spot) price of bitumen is $3,000 per ton, but you have no idea what the price will be in late 2019.
	- You learned that the ASX offers futures contracts on bitumen
	- This is a Long contract, as you are mitigating your risk.
