#### Data and Database
**Structured Data**
- Has the same defined format (e.g., relational database)
**Semi-structured data**
- Taxonomies (a hierarchical structure that organises the given data in parent-child relationships, based on the inherent concepts present in the data)
- They have some certain structure
- This structure is not identical
- An example is XML
**Unstructured data**
- Does not have any predefined format
- An example is plain text
#### Motivations for Studying Databases
Databases can support
1. Data management
2. Data analysis
Current trends
- Small data -> big data

When someone wants to look at their transaction history it needs to query all of the users recent transactions.

To maintain all of the data in which involve the client.
