2. **Why should we care about System Modelling?**
	- To describe a system

	- To communicate with executive management
	- To explain the basis of detailed, technical conversations.
		- Even if you're not an IT person, understanding how to use some of these models enables you to have informed conversations with your IT colleagues.
	- We want to understand how organisations use information systems.
	- Assess whether an is getting the most out of their technology.
3. **How can you use a rich picture?**
	- It helps people to visualise and discuss their own role in the organisation
	- It can be used to define the aspects of the organisation which are intended to be covered by the information system
	- It can be used to show up the worries of individuals, potential conflicts, and political issues
	- Lack of space on the paper forces decisions on what is really important.
4. How to develop a rich picture
	- What is the system that you are trying to model
	- Who are the actors involved in this narrative?
	- What types of technology are they using
	- Identify in this order
		- Actors
