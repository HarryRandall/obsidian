#### Assessment 2: BIS Analysis Report (BAR) (40%)

The BIS Assessment Report requires students to investigate an assigned, current topic(s) in Business Information Systems. The report requires research, analysis and leveraging academic literature to demonstrate a depth of analysis and understanding of the topic(s). Students will be given guidance on working with academic literature in Week 1. 

This assessment consists of two parts.

**Part 1: BAR Report. (25%)**

Students will submit an MS Word document via a Turnitin link on Wattle with no more than 2000 words. Text exceeding the word count may not be read.

**Part 2: BAR Oral (In Person) Review. (15%)**

Students will attend a 10 minute interactive, in person, review of their BAR. The review will be video recorded, which will enable later validation and verification of assessment if required, in accordance with point 7 in the ANU Student Assessment Coursework policy. The duration of the review is limited to 10 minutes and students must be on time. Additional time will not be added if students are late. Students must show their student ID or equivalent form of identification. 

It is expected that the BAR Oral review helps students demonstrate their depth of analysis and understanding of the assigned topic. Note that this is **not** a student presentation and slides are not required. 

If student performance in the Oral Review suggests academic misconduct in the preparation of their BAR Report, such as the use of AI, contract cheating or plagiarism, then the student will be referred to Academic Integrity for further action.

**AI USE**: The use of AI such as ChatGPT, to generate an essay or report is not allowed as it is akin to plagiarism. Students are required to demonstrate achievement of critical, analytical and synthesis skills in high quality works.

**Part 1 - BAR Analysis Report:** Due on Thursday of Week 7 (17/04/25) at 09:00 am via Turnitin on the course Wattle site.

**Part 2 - BAR Oral (In Person)** **Review:** Review sessions will be scheduled during weeks 8, 9 and 10. Students will be assigned a specific time slot.  

**Note - There are no extensions available for Part 2.**

Note that the teaching team will not be reviewing BAR drafts but are happy to discuss the direction and intent of your assessment.  In addition, you should review the exemplar, and accompanying notes, so that you have a sense of the teaching team's expectations.

The teaching team really wants you to do well so please review and give your self plenty of time to complete the assessment ![smile](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/theme/image.php/anu/core/1732710661/s/smiley "smile")
