#### Lecture 1
##### Variable Assignment
- We don't actually need all of the clauses. Some of them can be derived from others.
> **Example**
- $True$, then holds (regardless of $\sigma$)
- $p \vee q$, then it holds if $p$ is $true$ under $\sigma$ or $q$ is $true$ under $\sigma$
- $\neg p$, then it holds if $p$ is $false$ under $\sigma$

- $false$ - this is the same as $\neg True$
- $p \land q$ - this is the same as $\neg (\neg p \vee \neg q)$
- $p \implies q$ - this is the same as $\neg p \land q$

##### Expressive Completeness
A set $S$ of logical connectives is **expressively complete** if all Boolean functions can be defined using connectives in $S$.
- ($\land, \vee, \neg, \implies, True, False$) this is the base set with most of the functions, and it's expressively complete.
- ($\vee, \neg, True$) is expressively complete.
	- We can prove something like $\land$ with the formula
	- $\land = \neg (\neg p \vee \neg q)$ 
-  ($\land, \neg, True$) is expressively complete.

| p   | q   | $\neg p$ | $\neg q$ | $\neg p \vee \neg q$ | $\neg (\neg p \vee \neg q)$ | $p \land q$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | F        | F        | F                    | T                           | T           |
| T   | F   | F        | T        | T                    | F                           | F           |
| F   | T   | T        | F        | T                    | F                           | F           |
| F   | F   | T        | T        | T                    | F                           | F           |
- ($\vee, \neg)$ is not expressively complete.
- ($\land, True$) is not expressively complete.

##### Universal Quantifier
- The universal quantifier $\forall$ means for all.
###### Examples
- Let $D$ be the set {$1,2,3,4$}.
- Is the following statement true?
$$\forall x \epsilon D.X^2 \geq x$$
- This statement reads for all $x$ in the set $D$, $x^2$ is greater then or equal to $x$, which we know is true.

##### Proof by Counterexample
$$\forall \mathbb{R} \epsilon D.X^2 \geq x$$
The statement above states that for all real numbers, if you square it, it will be greater than the initial value. In order to prove is this incorrect, we can find a single example where it doesn't hold. We can test random values, such as 5, which = 25, so that's true. We could try 0, which is also true, and then we can try -1, which is 1, so this doesn't hold.

###### Examples
Let $S$ be the set {$2,3,4,5$}. Is the following statement true?
$$ \exists N \in  S \;| \;n^2=n$$
- There exists a value N in the set S, such that n squared = n.
- How can we prove that it is false? We need to show that it is false for all elements in S.
> To prove that an existentially quantified statement is true, we need to find at least one case where it holds.
