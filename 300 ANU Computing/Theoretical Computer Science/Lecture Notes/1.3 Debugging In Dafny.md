#### Lecture 7 — Debugging in Dafny: Knights & Knaves

##### Why Knights & Knaves?
- Practise specifying properties in logic and Dafny.  
- Learn **proof by contradiction**.  
- Spot incorrect specifications and debug with assertions.  

---

##### Single Person Puzzle
- Ask: “Are you a knight?”  
  - Knight → Yes  
  - Knave → Yes  
  - → Cannot determine.  

- Ask: “If I asked you whether you are a knight, what would you say?”  
  - Knight → Yes  
  - Knave → No  

Specification in Dafny:  
```c
Says(a) <==> (Says(a) <==> Knight(a))
Says(a) <==> (Says(a) <==> Knave(a))
```

---

##### Two-Person Puzzle (A & B)
- Ask each: “Is the other a knight?”  
  - Results are ambiguous (cannot determine).  

- Ask each: “If I asked the other whether they are a knight, what would they say?”  
  - Now the answers distinguish cases.  

Specification:  
```c
Says(a) <==> (Says(b) <==> Knight(b))
Says(b) <==> (Says(a) <==> Knave(a))
```

---

##### Proofs
- **If X says Y would say “Knight”, then X is a knight.**  
  - Assume X is a knave → contradiction → conclude X is a knight.  

- **If X says Y would say “Knave”, then X is a knave.**  
  - Assume X is a knight → contradiction → conclude X is a knave.  

---

##### Knights, Knaves, and Doors Puzzle
- Two doors (D1, D2), one is the exit.  
- Two people (knights/knaves).  
- Questions to each:  
  1. If I asked the other person whether D1 is the exit, what would they say?  
  2. Is D1 the exit?  

- These two questions are enough to work out the truth, depending on responses.  

---

##### Debugging the Specification
Incorrect Dafny model:  
```c
Says(b) <==> ((Says(a) <==> !DoorIsExit(d1)) && !DoorIsExit(d1))
```

- Problem: combining statements into one conjunctive condition is **not equivalent** to modelling them separately.  

Correct approach:  
```c
Says(b) <==> (Says(a) <==> !DoorIsExit(d1))
Says(b) <==> !DoorIsExit(d1)
```

---

##### Key Lesson
- **Be precise in specifications.**  
- Joining multiple statements with `&&` can change the meaning.  
- Dafny may find counterexamples if the specification does not match the intended logic.  

#### Lecture 8 — Proof Strategies

##### Proof by Implication
- To prove $A \Rightarrow B$:  
  1. Assume $A$ is true.  
  2. Prove $B$ using that assumption.  

```c
if (A){
  // proof of B using A.
  assert (A ==> B);
  assert(A);
  assert(B);
}
```

---

##### Proof by Case Split
- Law of excluded middle: $A \lor \lnot A$ always holds.  
- Do a case split: prove both cases separately.  

```c
assert (A || !A);
if (A){
  // proof using A
}
if (!A){
  // proof using !A
}
```

---

##### Proof by Contradiction
- Assume $\lnot A$.  
- Derive a contradiction.  
- Therefore $A$ must hold.  

```c
if (!A){
  // derive contradiction
  assert false;
}
assert A;
```

---

##### Proof with Existential Quantifier
- To prove $\exists x. A(x)$:  
  - Provide a witness $e$.  
  - Show $A(e)$ holds.  

```c
assert P(e);                  // assume we have proved P(e)
assert (exists x:T :: P(x));
```

- To use $\exists x. A(x)$:  
  - Introduce a **fresh variable** $v$ with the property $A(v)$.  
  - It must not conflict with other assumptions.  

```c
var x:T :| P(x);   // ":|" means "such that"
// Now x and P(x) can be used in the proof
```

---

##### Proof with Universal Quantifier
- To prove $\forall x. A(x)$:  
  - Take an **arbitrary** $x$.  
  - Show $A(x)$ holds.  

```c
forall x:T ensures P(x){
  // proof of P(x)
}
```

- To use $\forall x. A(x)$:  
  - If $e$ is an expression of type $T$, conclude $A(e)$.  

```c
assert (forall x:T :: P(x));  // assume this holds
assert P(e);                  // instantiate with e
```

⚠️ Wrong approach (invalid):  
- Assuming $x=2$, prove $x=2$, and then conclude $\forall x. x=2$.  
- Not valid, because $x$ was not arbitrary.

#### Lecture 9 — Proof Examples

##### Example 1: Even Numbers
Prove:  
$$\forall m,n \in \mathbb{Z}.\; even(m) \land even(n) \;\Rightarrow\; even(m+n)$$  

Definition:  
$$even(n) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}.\; n = 2k$$  

**Proof:**  
- Let $m,n$ be arbitrary even integers.  
- Then $m=2i$, $n=2j$ for some integers $i,j$.  
- $m+n = 2i + 2j = 2(i+j)$  
- Since $(i+j)$ is an integer, let $v=i+j$.  
- So $m+n=2v$ → $even(m+n)$.  

---

##### Example 2: Divisibility
Definition:  
- $div(n,m) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{N}.\; m = n \cdot k$  
- $prime(p) \equiv \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.\; div(n,p) \;\Rightarrow\; (n=p \lor n=1)$  

Prove:  
$$\forall x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}.\; div(x,y) \land div(y,z) \;\Rightarrow\; div(x,z)$$  

**Proof:**  
- Let $x,y,z$ be arbitrary integers with $x|y$ and $y|z$.  
- Then $y = x \cdot k$ and $z = y \cdot j$ for some $k,j \in \mathbb{Z}$.  
- Substitute: $z = (x \cdot k) \cdot j = x \cdot (k \cdot j)$.  
- Since $k \cdot j$ is an integer, $z = x \cdot i$ for $i=k \cdot j$.  
- Therefore $x|z$.  

---

##### Example 3: Parity of Consecutive Integers
Prove:  
$$\forall m \in \mathbb{Z}.\; (even(m) \land odd(m+1)) \;\lor\; (odd(m) \land even(m+1))$$  

Definition:  
- $odd(n) \equiv \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}.\; n = 2k+1$  

**Proof by Cases:**  
- Let $m$ be arbitrary. Any integer is either even or odd.  

**Case 1:** $m$ is even.  
- Then $m = 2k$ for some $k$.  
- $m+1 = 2k+1$ → odd.  

**Case 2:** $m$ is odd.  
- Then $m = 2k+1$ for some $k$.  
- $m+1 = (2k+1)+1 = 2(k+1)$ → even.  

Therefore, consecutive integers have opposite parity.

##### Dafny Example: Divisibility by 5
```c
ghost predicate DividesByFive(x:int) 
  { exists k:int :: x == 5 * k }

lemma multDividesFive()
  ensures forall x:int, y:int :: 
    DividesByFive(x) && DividesByFive(y) ==> DividesByFive(x * y)
{
  forall x:int, y:int 
    ensures DividesByFive(x) && DividesByFive(y) ==> DividesByFive(x * y)
  {
    if (DividesByFive(x)) {
      var k:int :| x == 5 * k;
      if (DividesByFive(y)) {
        var z:int :| y == 5 * z;
        assert (x * y == (5 * k) * (5 * z));
        assert (x * y == 5 * 5 * k * z);
        assert (x * y == 5 * (5 * k * z));
      }
    }
  }
}
```
