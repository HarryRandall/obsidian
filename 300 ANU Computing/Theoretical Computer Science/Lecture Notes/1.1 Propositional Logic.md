#### Verification
Programs have bugs. We need a way of ensuring that a program is correct according to its **specification**.
- Why is this important?
	- Think of safety-critical systems, e.g., cars, airplanes.
	- Financial systems
	- Energy systems
- What problems could it cause?
- Danger to people.
- Financial loss.
- Loss of critical infrastructure
###### Example 1
- The Ariane 5 rocket.
- It exploded due to a software bug.
###### Example 2
- The DAO was a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that was launched in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain. After raising $150 million USD worth of ETH through a token sale, the DAO was hacked due to vulnerabilities in its code base.
- Ethereum now uses Hoare-style logic to prevent this happening again.
###### Example 3
- The Needham Schroeder Public Key Protocol
- This protocol was in use for 17 years before a flaw was found using formal methods.
- The flaw was a security risk - an attacker could get access to another user's encrypted information.
- A formal verification approach called model checking was used to find the flaw.

> **Why don't we just test a program?**
- Testing explores some paths, but not all the paths.
- Verification proves that a program is correct for all paths.
