### Understanding Large Systems
- Large systems are complex and difficult to understand.
- Approaches include consulting documentation, experts, or using experience with patterns.
- Observation and hypothesis testing are essential for understanding interactions between components.
### Case Study: The Maintainability Index
- Maintainability Index scores code from 0 to 100 to indicate ease of maintenance.
- Higher scores indicate better maintainability (green, yellow, and red ratings).
- Initially developed through statistical analysis, the metric simplifies complexity using Halstead Volume, Cyclomatic Complexity, and Lines of Code.
### Case Study: Autonomous Vehicle Safety
- Quality and safety are assessed using metrics such as test coverage, model accuracy, failure rates, and milage.
- Metrics provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicle software.
### Measurement for Decision Making
- Measurement assigns numbers based on models or theories to describe attributes, reducing uncertainty.
- Software quality metrics help in decision-making but must be carefully validated to ensure relevance and accuracy.
### Understanding Your Data
- Effective data understanding involves verifying causation, avoiding cofounding variables, and ensuring validity (construct, internal, and external).
- Measurement reliability ensures consistency and reduces uncertainty through repeated testing.
### Metrics and Incentives
- Metrics can influence behaviour (Good-hart's Law), with productivity incentives potentially leading to negative effects, such as reduced intrinsic motivation, or short-term focus.
- Examples include lines of code per day and number of bugs fixed.
### Gaols, Signals, Metrics
- Google's GSM framework defines goals (desired outcomes), signals (indicators of achievement), and metrics (measurable proxies for signals).
- The approach helps align metrics with high-level gaols, even if direct measurement is not feasible.
