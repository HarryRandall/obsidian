### Architecture
- Architecture is the organisation of a software system, influencing its performance, security, and maintainability.
- **Components and Interfaces**: Key to modularity; each component should have a defined function.
- **Principles**: Abstraction, decomposition, and separation of concerns help manage complexity.
- **Goal**: Create a reliable, secure, and efficient product by choosing suitable technology and structuring it well.
### Security in Architecture
- **Centralised vs. Distributed**: Centralised security is easier to manage but risks complete data loss if breached; distributed security isolates risks.
- **Layered Security**: Multiple layers (e.g., authentication, encryption) protect against various attack vectors.
- Trade-off: Security often impacts usability, as more security layers can slow down user access and interaction.
###  Architectural Complexity
- Complexity arises from numerous interconnected components.
- To reduce complexity:
    - **Localise Dependencies**: Keep related components within the same module.
    - **Reduce Shared Dependencies**: Minimise shared components to simplify maintenance.
- Excessive complexity can lead to errors, increased maintenance, and vulnerability risks.
### Design Guidelines
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure each component addresses a specific concern, avoiding duplication.
- **Stable Interfaces**: Design interfaces that are stable over time to prevent frequent changes.
- **Layered Architecture**: Components interact within layers, avoiding cross-layer dependencies for clarity and efficiency.
### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Security, Performance, Reliability** are cross-cutting concerns, impacting all layers and components.
- Addressing these concerns early can prevent issues across the entire system, as modifications later can be challenging.
### Distribution and Client-Server Architecture
- **Client-Server Model**: Distributes tasks between client (user interface) and server (business logic, data).
- **Multi-Tier Architecture**: Additional layers (e.g., application servers) improve scalability and reliability.
- **Communication Protocols**: Typically HTTP, with data represented in XML or JSON for standardisation and ease.
