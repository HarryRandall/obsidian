### Monolithic vs Service-Oriented
- **Monolithic Architecture:** Single, unified codebase handling all aspects of an application; often less scalable and harder to modify without system-wide impact.
- **Service-Orientated Architecture (SOA):** Divides functionality into services with specific tasks; emphasises reusability and integration but can become complex.
- **Microservices**: An evolved SOA where services are smaller, independently deployable, and focused on single functionalities, enhancing scalability and flexibility.
### Microservices
- **Characteristics**
	- **Single Responsibility:** Each microservice handles one business function.
	- **Independence:** Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
	- **Data Management:** Each services often manages it's own data to avoid cross-service dependencies.
- **Benefits**:
	- **Scalability:** Only needed service scale, optimising resource use.
	- **Resilience:** Faults are isolated to individual services.
	- **Faster Development Cycles:** Teams can work on seperate services concurrently
- **Challenges**:
	- Complexity in deployment, managing distributed data, and inter-service communication. 
### Microservice Design Example
- Example: Authentication System with microservices for UID management, password management, user info management, and authentication.
- Each service perms specific tasks (e.g., UID service only manages user IDs) contributing to overall modularity and ease of maintenance.

### RESTful Services
- Definition: REST (Representational State Transfer) enables stateless communication over HTTP, commonly used in microservices.
- **Principles**:
	- **Statelessness:** Each request from client to server must contain all information to understand and process the request.
	- **Uniform Interface:** Use standard HTTP verbs (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) for CRUD operations.
	- **Resource Identification:** Resources are addressable via URIs, making the system scaleable and easy to navigate
- Advantages:
	- Simple and lightweight, fitting well with microservices.
	- Enables integration with web-based applications and mobile devices effectively.
