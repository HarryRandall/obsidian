### Open Source
- Open-source software (OSS) is freely available for use, modification, and distribution, fostering collaboration and innovation.
- **Advantages**:
    - Cost-effective and community-driven improvements.
    - Transparency enhances security as the code is open to review.
- **Challenges**: Compatibility issues, reliance on community support, and potential security risks if unmaintained.

### Licenses
- **Permissive Licenses** (e.g., MIT, Apache): Allow redistribution and modification with minimal restrictions, including for commercial purposes.
- **Copyleft Licenses** (e.g., GPL): Require derivative works to adopt the same license, ensuring continued openness.
- **License Compliance**: Ensuring proper use of licenses is critical to avoid legal risks in both proprietary and open-source projects.

### Dependency Management
- Dependencies are external libraries or frameworks that a project relies on, and managing them ensures stability and compatibility.
- **Tools**: Package managers like npm, Maven, and pip help automate version control and conflict resolution.
- **Risks**: Outdated or vulnerable dependencies can compromise security, so regular updates and audits are essential.

### Ethics
- Ethical considerations include responsible use of open-source software, respecting license terms, and contributing back to the community.
- **Social Responsibility**: Ensuring OSS is not used for harmful purposes, adhering to fair labor practices, and promoting accessibility.
- **Community Impact**: Contributing to documentation, patches, and reporting bugs helps sustain and improve open-source ecosystems.
