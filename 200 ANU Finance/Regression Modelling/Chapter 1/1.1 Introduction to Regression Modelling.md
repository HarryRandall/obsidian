- Regression is a study of dependence and association
	- Started with studying dependence of one 'outcome/response' variable on one 'predicator/explanatory' variable.
	- We can have more than one 'explanatory' variable.
- In this course we will study the method of linear regression
- Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is the study of association between two variables (studied in the first half of the course).
- In the second half we will extend the ideas of SLR to multiple explanatory variables and develop the concepts of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

- Assess the fit of the model ensuring assumptions are met
- Diagnose any violations and errors
- Remedy these violations and errors
- Finally, make inferences

Linear models can help us in:
- Description
- Prediction
- Control

Regression models do not provide evidence of causation but, only association. 

Here are some examples of questions where regression models may provide answers:
1. Are daughters taller than mothers?
2. Does changing the class size affect the success of students?
3. Does the price of a house increase with increase in living area?
4. Do countries with a higher per capita income have lower birth rates?
5. Are woman underpaid compared to men?

##### Population and Sample
- **Population** (true world)
	- A collection of the whole of something that you are interested in.
	- Parameters: true values describing the population, for example $μ$ $σ^2$. Usually they are unknown.
- **Sample** (Your subjective world)
	- A set of individuals randomly drawn from a population.
	- Statistics: calculated from the sample served as estimators of the parameters, for example $\bar{X}$, $S^2$
Usually, we draw a sample from a population, and we try to make it so that the sample represents the whole population.
##### Properties of Estimators
- It has random variables ($\bar{X}$)
- It has a probability distribution, often called sampling distribution
$$E(X) = μ, Var(\bar{X}) = \frac{σ^2}{n}$$
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT): $\bar{X}$ is asymptotically normally distributed.
- Make statistical inferences: confidence interval and hypothesis testing.
#### Regression 
- Statistical methodology that describes the relation between two or more variables so that a response or outcome variable can be estimated from the other explanatory variables.  
- This methodology is widely used in business, the social and behavioural sciences, the biological sciences, and many other disciplines.
###### Example 1
- Predict sales of a product using relationship between sales and amount spent on advertising.
- Use a Simple Linear Regression Model
	- 1 Explanatory Variable
	- 1 Outcome Variable
###### Example 2
- Does the price of a house increase with increase in living area?
- Use a Multiple Linear Regression Model, we have multiple predictors.
	- Many Explanatory Variable
	- 1 Outcome Variable
- The outcome is always one variable.

##### Relation Between Variables
- A **functional relation** between two variables is expressed as a mathematical formula;
$$ Y = f(X)$$
- A functional relation is "perfect" mapping from $X$ to $Y$.
- A **statistical relation** is not perfect. The observations are typically scattered around this curve.

- Not all of the points lie on the statistical relationship, they are not directly on the line.

##### Construction of Regression Models
- $X$: Independent variable, predictor, regressor, covariate.
- $Y$: Dependent variable, response, outcome, output.
- Only a limited number of useful covariates should be included in the regression model.
- How do you chose?
	- Through exploratory studies, theory, etc

**Functional Form of Regression Relation**
- Choice of $f$ in the functional form $Y = f(X)$ is tied to the choice of covariates.
- Sometimes the relevant theory may indicate the appropriate form for $f$.
- Typically needs to be determined empirically from the date. Scatter plot may help.
- Linear or quadratic regression functions are often a first good approximation. 

**Scope of Models**
- We usually need to restrict the coverage of the models to some interval or region of values.
- The scope is determined either by the design of the investigation or by the range of data at hand.
- The model may perform badly given previously unobserved data.
