- Regression is a study of dependence and association
	- Started with studying dependence of one 'outcome/response' variable on one 'predicator/explanatory' variable.
	- We can have more than one 'explanatory' variable.
- In this course we will study the method of linear regression
- Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is the study of association between two variables (studied in the first half of the course).
- In the second half we will extend the ideas of SLR to multiple explanatory variables and develop the concepts of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

- Assess the fit of the model ensuring assumptions are met
- Diagnose any violations and errors
- Remedy these violations and errors
- Finally, make inferences

Linear models can help us in:
- Description
- Prediction
- Control

Regression models do not provide evidence of causation but, only association. 

Here are some examples of questions where regression models may provide answers:
1. Are daughters taller than mothers?
2. Does changing the class size affect the success of students?
3. Does the price of a house increase with increase in living area?
4. Do countries with a higher per capita income have lower birth rates?
5. Are woman underpaid compared to men?
