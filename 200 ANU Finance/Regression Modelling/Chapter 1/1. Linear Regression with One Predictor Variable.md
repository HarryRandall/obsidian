### Preface
- Regression analysis utilises a relation between two or more quantatative variables so that a response or outcome variable can be predicated from others.
- This would include:
	- The size of the vocabulary of a child can be predicted by utilising the relationship between size of vocabulary and age of the child and amount of education of the parents.
	- The length of hospital stay of a surgical patient can be predicted by utilising the relationship between the time in the hospital and the severity of the operation.


### 1.1 Relation Between Variables

**Functional relation**
- Expressed by a formula: $Y=f(X)$, $Y = f(X)$, where
    - $X$ = independent variable
    - $Y$ = dependent variable
- Every $X$ value gives exactly one $Y$ value.
- Example: Selling a unit for $2 means total revenue increases perfectly linearly with units sold.

**Statistical relation**
- Not perfect, so data points do not all fall exactly on a curve.
- Example: Midyear vs year-end employee evaluations:
    - $X$ = midyear score (predictor)
    - $Y$ = year-end score (response)

- For $X=80$, there may be multiple $Y$ values (for example, $76$ and $81$).
- A line of best fit summarises the general trend, but most points deviate from it. This deviation is called variation.

### 1.2 Regression Models and Their Uses
- A regression model is a formal means of expressing the two essential ingredients of a statistical relation.
	- A tendency of the response variable $Y$ to vary with the predictor variable $X$ in a systematic fashion.
	- A scattering of points around the curve of statistical relationship.

### 1.3 Simple Linear Regression Model with Distribution of Error Terms Unspecific.
- A basic regression model where there is only one predictor variable and the regression function is linear can be stated as:
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \epsilon_i$$
- $Y_i$ is the value of the response variable in the $i$th trail.
- $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ and parameters.
- $X_i$ is a known constant, namely, the value of the predictor variable in the $i$th trail.
- $\epsilon_i$ is a random error term with a mean $E\{\epsilon_i\}$ = $\sigma^2$.
