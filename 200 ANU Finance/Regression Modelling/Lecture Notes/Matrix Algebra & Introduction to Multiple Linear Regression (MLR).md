## Matrices
- Won't be assessed in the final exam.
- A random vector or a random matrix contains elements that are random variables.
- Expectation of random matrix: Take element-wise expectation.

- Denoted as 'Column Vector'
- Bold capitalised letter = random vector matrix
- Capitalised letter = Scalar matrix
- Probability identies

## SLR in Matrix Terms
$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i, i=1,\dots,n.$$
Which implies
$$Y_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \epsilon_1$$
$$Y_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_2 + \epsilon_2$$
