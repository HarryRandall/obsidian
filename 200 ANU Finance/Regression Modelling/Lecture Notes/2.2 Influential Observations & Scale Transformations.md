- A data point has high leverage if it has "extreme" predictor X values.
- A data point is influential if it largely influences the fitting of regression modes.
- High Y outliers will pull the slope drastically. 
- Try the different graphs ("which = x"), and what they represent.

**Lecture Example - Teluca Company Dataset**
- With an extreme outlier, the slope changes from 2.05 -> 1.95, so a ~5% change.
- Once you see an outlier, determine if it's a one-off case, or is it part of a deeper problem that's yet to be modelled.
