#### Lecture 1
##### Net Present Value (NPV)
- General term referring to discounted value for stream of cash flows.
- **Objective**: Estimate cash flows available to providers of capital, and discount at the return required by those providers.

To meet this objective, you need:
1. Forecast of cash flows (may arise from a company model)
2. Cost of capital estimate

Various approaches exist based on the same principle, but employing different structure and terminology. Key points of differentiation:
1. **Perspective**: total enterprise vs equity holders
2. **Treatment** of tax shield on debt: discount rate vs cash flows
3. **Discount rate**: $WACC$ vs $K_{eU}$ vs $K_{eL}$ (reflects above 2 points)
4. **Capital structure assumption**: target (static) vs variable
5. **Presentation**: cash flows vs capital investment + economic profit.

- The higher we expect the return, the lower we set the price.
	- High risk, low price.
	- Low risk, high price.

##### Enterprise DCF Model
- The left hand side = right hand side.
- The enterprise value is the value of the companies operation.
- The right hand side is used to support the left hand side of the company (debt and equity).

To get the equity per share, we subtract the debt value from the enterprise value, then we divide the equity by the number of shares.

**Steps in Enterprise DCF**
1. Estimate NPV of cash flows from operations, discounting WACC
	a) Free cash flow generated over forecast horizon
	b) Continuing value
2. Value non-operating assets
3. **Enterprise value** (from screenshot above) = value of operations + non-operating assets
4. Identify and value of non-equity claims (e.g., debt, options, prefs, etc)
5. Equity value = enterprise value - value of non-equity claims.
6. Valuation of shares = equity value / number of shares.

When doing a DCF, you are predicting the future cash flows of the company. When doing these, you often assume that all of the cash comes in on a certain date (end of the year like December 31). This isn't the case however, as firms tend to get money throughout the year.

Because of this, you need to add a mid-year-adjustment, which we can do by incrementing by 0.5 instead of 0.1 when calculating the DCF.
$$\text{Annual DCF}\;\;PV = \frac{100}{(1.1)^{1}} = 90.91$$
$$\text{Mid-Year DCF}\;\;PV = \frac{100}{(1.1)^{0.5}} = 95.35$$

**Worked steps in Enterprise DCF**
1) Given to us, NPV = 113,395
	1) With the mid-year adjustment factor, we get $113,395 \times 1.039 = 117,840$.
2) Non operating assets = $4,136 + 148 = 4,284$ 
3) Enterprise value = $117,840 + 4,284 = 122,124$
4) Non-equity claims = $(10,872) + (5,042) + (5,841) + (14) = 21,769$
5) Equity Value = $122,124 - 21,769 = 100,355$ 
6) Valuation of shares = $\frac{100355m}{923m} = 109$

- Non controlling interest
- NOPLAT = Net Operation Profit - Adjusted Tax

**Free Cash Flows**
- NOPLAT + non-cash items - Investments in Invested Capital.
- Free cash flows is after-tax cash flows available to all investors.
- The DCF valuation will be built upon these cash flows.
- Excludes the non-operating cash flows (treated and valued separately) and financing items (i.e., shifts in invested capital).
