##### What is Value?
- **Rule 1**
	- Value = net present value of future cash flows
- **Rule 2**
	- All valuation methods ultimately come back to Rule 1
	- Valuation methods are only valid as they are somehow linked to the net present value of future cash flows.
##### Valuation Approaches
1. Multiple-based valuation: Capitalisation of near-term earnings or cash flow (E.G., PE)
2. Asset-based valuations (adding up individual company assets)
3. Net present value (or discounted cash flow) techniques

**General comments**:
- Each approach has strengths and weaknesses
- Arguments for a composite of valuation indicators
- Why does the course start with DCF?
	- This is the method that is most closely linked to **Rule 1**.

##### A way of thinking about company value
1. A company generates an (**uncertain**) stream of cash flows from its **existing operations**. The value of such operations is the NPV of these cash flows.
	- If a company can get more net cash flow out of its existing operations, the company will be worth more.
	- Need to account for cash reinvested to maintain operations.
	- If the cost of capital falls, the business is also worth more.
2. Additional value is created if the company can invest in new projects earning above the cost of capital.
	- 'True' growth stocks have access to such opportunities.
		- Young companies get value from the additional value that **could** be created.
		- **Amazon** had negative cash flows, but there is potential additional cash flows. These companies are called 'Growth Stocks'
	- Investments that earn below cost of capital will destroy value, regardless of what happens to top-line sales growth.

##### Week 1 review
- **Value** = net present value of future cash flows
- 3 valuation approaches
	1. Multiple-based valuations
	2. Asset-based valuations
	3. Discounted cash flows
- $Growth rate = Investment rate \times ROIC$
	- $ROIC$ = return on invested capital
	- Balance growth and ROIC to create firm value
- Cash flow = Earnings $\times (1 - \frac{growth}{roic})$
	- Higher $ROIC$, higher cash flow
- Value creation by type of growth:
	1. New product to market
	2. Expand existing market
	3. Increase share in growing market
	4. Compete for share in a stable market (for more market share)
	5. Acquire new businesses
- $ROIC > WACC \implies create value$ 
- $ROIC < WACC \implies destroy value$ 
- $WACC$ = Weight Average Cost of Capital
