KGW: Chapter 10 Review Questions 1, 2, 4, 6


Question 1: Exhibit 10.13 presents **historical data for ShipCo**, a manufacturer of ships. Based on the data, how has **ShipCo performed** over the past five years? What is its **ROIC for years 2 to 5** (using average invested capital)? What is its **operating margin**? What is its **capital turnover**? Is it creating **more or less value** over time? Assume an **operating tax rate of 30%** and **cost of capital of 9%**.


- Operating taxes = operating income $\times$ tax rate.
- NOPLAT = Operating Taxes - Operating income

- Invested capital = Net Working Capital + Fixed Assets + Intangible Assets
- Net Working Capital = Current Asset - Current Liability

- Total Funds Invested = Debt + Equity + Other Claims
	- Or = Invested Capital + Non-Operating Assets

 - Calculate ROIC $\frac{NOPLAT}{Invested Capital}$ 
 - Operating Margin = $\frac{NOPLAT}{Revenue}$
 - Capital turner: $$\frac{\text{Revenue}}{\frac{IC_{t-1} + IC_t)}{2}}$$

Question 2: Using the data presented in Question 1, **decompose operating margin and capital turnover**. What has been occurring at ShipCo over the five-year period? What might be driving these results?

- The ROIC is > WACC of 9%, 
- Economic Profit = (ROIC - WACC) * Average Invested Capital
- 

Question 4: You are an **equity analyst** and have computed the following figures for two manufacturers of paper products. The first, **PaperPro**, has NOPLAT of $\$325$ million, invested capital without goodwill of $\$2{,}500$ million, and goodwill of $\$950$ million. The second, **ExpertPaper**, has NOPLAT of $\$750$ million, invested capital without goodwill of $\$6{,}000$ million, and no goodwill. If the **cost of capital** for both firms is **10%**, are the firms creating value in this year? Which company has the **better financial performance**?

**PaperPro**:
- NOPLAT of $\$325$ million
- Invested capital without goodwill of $\$2{,}500$ million
- Goodwill of $\$950$ million
- Cost of capital = $10\%$
**ExpertPaper**:
- NOPLAT of $\$750$ million
- Invested capital without goodwill of $\$6{,}000$ million
- No goodwill
- Cost of capital = $10\%$

ROIC without goodwill, both companies appear to be creating value (ROIC > WACC). If you use goodwill although, then PaperPro will drop.

Therefore you want ExpertPaper, as with or without goodwill, ROIC > WACC.


Question 6: Which **interest coverage ratio**, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (**EBITDA**) to interest or **EBITA to interest**, will lead to a higher number? When is the **EBITDA interest coverage ratio** more appropriate than the EBITA ratio? When is the **EBITA interest coverage ratio** more appropriate than the EBITDA ratio?
