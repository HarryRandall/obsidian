## Foundations
- A company can be viewed as a collection of assets
- Another view on 'value' is to examine what this collection of assets may be worth on the open market (to sell).
- This value may not always equal your NPV estimate - although clearly asset prices and NPV of cash flows should be related (e.g., diversified conglomerates are prices at a discount relative to more "focused" companies if firm characteristics and other factors are controlled).

Three variations on the asset-based perspective on value:
1. Price / asset backing
2. SOTP / break-up valuations
3. Takeover valuations

## Price / Net Asset Backing
Two forms:
1. Price / Net Book Value of Equity (also called 'Market-to-Book')
2. Price / Net Tangible Assets

- No. of shares: all classes of ordinary shares (some classes of shares might carry less than one or no voting rights).
- NTA preferred when valuing intangible assets is subjective or 'grey' - e.g. 20% of P&G and Unilever's total assets are the value of their intangible assets: brand names.
- Cenceptually appropriate to dilute for options, etc. Although rarely done in practice, give it some consideration.
- Premium over NetBookValue is sometimes attributed to 'franchise value'.
- Better when asset backing is meaningful, e.g. REITs, financials.

Net Book Value of Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
Net Tangible Assets = Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Intangible assets
