## Forecasting Advice
- Don't fall into the trap of mundane extrapolation.
	- Overusing historical data and historical average.
- Need to think about non-financial (qualitative) operating drivers like:
	- **Context of the company**
		- Broad economic outlook
			- If the economy is doing well, the company is likely to do well.
			- Discount rates are low.
		- Competitive environment
			- Industry Structure
			- Porter's Analysis
	- Any company capabilities or other competitive advantages
	- Technological changes, and their potential impact.
	- Potential cost (as well as benefit) of any strategies being adopted
	- Impact of major cost variates (e.g., oil); including their links to revenues
	- Sustainability of current industry margins / return on capital
- ROIC and its components provide an overarching diagnostic.

**Company Performance: A Graphical Representation**

![[Pasted image 20250920112805.png]]

- There's a bigger local and global economy
- Within the economy, there is an industry.
	- How does the global and local economy affect the industry structure?
- Within the industry, there is a competitive environment where the firm needs to interact with the customers, the suppliers, and the competitors.
- How does the company interact in this economy?
	- What are the advantages / disadvantages of this
- These all leads to the Company's performance.

When making a forecast, it's important to view the company within this context.

### Revenues
**Possible Methods**:
1. **Inflation + Real Growth**
	- Ensure inflation assumption is up-to-date and forward-looking
		- Inflation usually a positive number
	- Ensure inflation assumption is consistent with WACC
	- Forecasting 'real growth' often trickier than it looks
2. **Price $\times$ Volume**
	- Can focus on the company itself
	- Don't forget that there is often a trade-off between Prices & Volumes
	- Check that the results make sense from a "macro" perspective.
		- i.e., that you have not inadvertently assumed growth rates well in excess of that achievable within the industry of economic context.
3. **Forecast the industry, then divide the spoils ('top down')**
	- Forecast industry revenue first.

#### Example - Woolworths

#### Example - Coca-Cola

- You break break the company into different categories for the segment analysis
- These drivers make up the total revenue for the company.

### Operating Costs
1. **Forecast Margins** (EBITDA typically)
2. **Model each major cost component** (COGS, SG&A, R&D, etc)
	- As % of **revenues** (the more stable approach)
	- Forecast levels or % growth rates (be wary in breaking revenue link)
	- Directly add a component for "cost savings" from mergers, etc
		- Combining the companies will create a synergy, or cost savings.
3. **Model each line explicitly** (i.e., go down to the next level)
	- Identify the driver for each cost item, and forecast accordingly
		- Total Wagers = Average Wage Rate $\times$ Number of Employees
	- May be useful where major cost items decoupled from revenue
	- Scope for variables vs fixed cost delineation (if it makes sense)

### Capital Expenditure
- Very important item - directly impacts on the DCF valuation
- How much you spend on your fixed assets.

**Methods of forecasting** (KGW)
1. Forecast stock of fixed capital as % of **revenues**, and then solve for:
	- capex = closing net PP&E $-$ opening net PP&E + depreciation (**KGW preferred**)
	- You're assuming that you need a certain amount of assets to support a certain amount of revenue. 
2. Capex flow as % of revenues (makes sense in some industries)
3. Explicit dollar value forecasts (may be suitable in some instances)
**Other possibilities**:
4. Capex = depreciation (almost certainly wrong)
5. Estimate 'maintenance capex' (severe underestimate likely)
6. Assume a percentage growth rate (keep an eye on revenue growth)

- Investments may involve additional, 'expansion' capex, consistent with forecasted ROIC?

#### Capex Example

**Opening Position**  
- Open net PPE: \$400  
- Machines A, B, C, D = \$100 each  
- Capacity = 250 units/year per machine  
- Total initial capacity = 1,000 units/year  

**Depreciation**  
- Machines A, B, C, D → Depreciation = \$100 ($25 per machine)
- Closing net PPE (A–D only) = \$300  
- Remaining production capacity (A–D) = 750 units/year  

**Capex Investment**  
- New machine: Machine E  
- Cost = \$120  
- Capacity = 300 units/year  

**Production and Revenue**  
- Unit price = \$5  
- Production = 1,000 units  
- Revenue = \$5,000  

**Closing Position**  
- Close net PPE = \$420  
  - Machines A, B, C, D, E  
- Total production capacity = 1,050 units/year

### Depreciation
- Depreciation is modelled under the KGW model as percentage of net PPE (Property, Plant & Equipment)
- Historical rates often provide a reasonable guide, but are they stable?
	- Make adjustments accordingly
- Depreciation is a non-cash item, which is added back when generating cash flow for DCF valuation. So does the depreciation rate matter?
	1. Depreciation rate impacts profits. It hence matters for PE or EBIT multiple valuation (and analysts who care about accurate profit forecasts)
	2. If net PPE is forecasted as a percentage of revenues (KGW Model option 1), then a direct link between depreciation and capex (hence cash flow) is established.
	3. If capex is forecasted directly (KGW Model options 2, 3), then the rate of depreciation will impact invested capital and hence ROIC over time.

### Interest
- Interest paid by the company does not affect the DCF valuation, where it matters is the cost of debt input into the WACC.
- Interest expense matters for profits, and hence PE valuations.
- With respect to interest expense:
	- Cash amount should refer to interest actually paid.
	- Interest expensed may not always equal interest actually paid, e.g. where interest is capitalised.
		- Interest Capitalised is the interest you need to pay the bank.
	- The interest component of WACC should refer to the required return by debt investors.
	- Beware of the debt circular (KGW suggests prior year debt as the basis)
	- **Interest Paid** $\implies$ **Effects Cash Flow** $\implies$ **Effects Level Of Debt** $\implies$ **Interest Paid**

### Tax Advice
- Complicated, just use Australia's Tax Rate.
### Other
**Balance Sheet Items**
- KGW suggests forecasting the stock/balance (e.g. working capital as % of revenue) and calculating the flow / change; rather than forecasting the flows and calculating the stock.
**Non-operating items**
	- Ultimate aim is to estimate their current valuation
	- Avoid forecasting future values
	- Income from non-operating assets will affect forecasted financial accounts (including earnings); but cash flows should be stripped out and treated separately for valuation purposes.
**Financing Flows & Capital Structure**
- Forecast capital structure can be rendered irrelevant to the valuation by basing WACC on "target" gearing.
- Practice of directing residual cash towards either debt or cash is common, easy and acceptable.

## ROIC - Why does it matter?

$$ \text{ROIC (from operations)} = \frac{\text{profits from operations (NOPLAT)}}{\text{invested capital in operations}}$$
- **Why ROIC matters** - looking backwards
	- ROIC > WACC implies company has created shareholder value.
	- Helps identify 'good' and 'bad' business.
	- Tells us if we should maintain the current level of invested capital, or if we should invest more. This will support future revenue growth.
-  **Why ROIC matters** - looking forwards
	- ROIC provides over-arching diagnostic check on forecasts.
	- Abnormally high/low ROIC may hint at potential for mean reversion
	- Information in ROIC trends about what is happening at the margin

### ROIC Decomposition & 'Value Drivers'
Value creation could be distilled to 4 core value drivers:
1. Revenue growth - determines 'size' of the company.
2. Operating margin - how much profit generated from revenue.
3. Capital efficiency - how much capital required to support operations
4. Cost of capital - the required rate of return / discount rate.

$$
ROIC \;=\; \frac{\text{After-Tax Operating Margin} \times \text{Revenue}}{\text{Invested Capital}}
\;=\; \frac{NOPLAT}{\text{Revenue}} \times \frac{\text{Revenue}}{IC}
$$

### Analysis of Revenue Growth
- Historical revenue data can be difficult to interpret
	- Acquisitions
	- Expansion of existing operations
	- Foreign exchange effects
	- Accounting policy changes

### What ROIC is achievable?
**Key Questions**
- How sustainable is current ROIC?
- What is the likely marginal ROIC or RONIC
- Is there something special about the company or industry that supports a sustained high (or low) ROIC or RONIC?
**Key considerations**
1. Industry environment, e.g. Porter's five forces, game theory.
2. Competitive advantages, e.g. product differentiation, efficiency
3. Core competencies, e.g. ability to innovate
