## Recap
1. A company generates an (uncertain) stream of cash flows from its existing operations. The value of such operations is the NPV of these cash flows.
	- If a company can get more net cash flow out of its existing operations, the company will be worth more.
	- Need to account for cash reinvested to maintain operations.
	- If the cost of capital falls, the business is also worth more.
2. Additional value is created if the company can invest in new projects earning above the cost of capital.
	- 'True' growth stocks have access to such opportunities.
	- Investments that earn below cost of capital will destroy value, regardless of what happens to top-line sales growth.

## Investment Opportunities: The link to value
- So far, we have focused on modelling, forecasting and valuing the current operations $\dots$ including reinvestment in those operations.
- Most probably your company is forecasted to generate loads of Free Cash Flows that is applied to financial flows, e.g. pay dividends, reduce debt.
- This is not how the world works: They will probably spend the cash!
- A key value driver (i.e., source of change in value) is how a company chooses to use the cash flows and assets at its disposal.

**Questions to ask:**
- How might the company deploy cash flow?
- Will any investment earn a return exceeding cost of capital.

## Organic Growth
- Term 'organic growth' refers to ability to grow existing operations.
- Often associated with fast revenue growth, but this is not enough in its own right to create value.
- Return at the margin is what matters most.
	- ROI > WACC (the hurdle rate)
	- Growing revenues faster than invested capital => ROIC rises
	- I.E., operating leverage, scalable business.
- Companies can grow revenues and possibly EPS (earnings per share) by increasing invested capital (e.g. earnings retention, borrowings), but value only created if marginal ROIC > cost of capital

### Example
**Retail Sales (consumer staples) - a pandemic recount**
- Spending on groceries and toiletries in the week ending Mar. 20 was 80% higher than the same period last year.
- For the week ending Mar. 27, the growth has moderated to 46% higher than the same period the prior year; alcohol soared 86% higher.

**Does the growth increase Woolworths value?**
- Where to start?
- What framework to use?
- Drivers? Sustainability?
	- Pandemic - we don't know how long it's going to last.
- Price vs. value, which perspective?

## Investment Issues
- Investments can be like a double-edged sword

- Prerequisite for growth
- Source of risk
	- Expansion of capacity may dilute returns (spreading of revenues over larger capital base; impact on pricing power.)
	- Expansion often occurs at top of cycle.
	- Tendency for companies to expand at the same time.
	- Short term dilution (funding & depreciation during ramp-up)

## Evaluating New Investments
- Don't take the company's word that an investment is NPV positive. Do your own number crunching if possible.
- Three types of investment
	1. Capacity expansion (view with skepticism)
	2. Creation of new products or markets (more uncertain, judge on merits)
	3. Efficiency enhancing (payoffs usually more reliable)
- Some questions to ask when a company invests:
	- Where is the competitive advantage?
	- Any impact on industry structure?
	- How will other players react?
	- Do I trust management? What is driving their decision?

### Example
![[Pasted image 20250929180207.png]]

- Inputs are all given.
**Sales**
- Sales = Product Price * Volume Sold
- Variable costs = volume sold * variable cost
- Fixed costs = 200 (fixed value)
- Depreciation = 100 ( fixed value)
- Costs = variable costs + fixed costs + depreciation
**EBIT**
- EBIT = sales - costs
- Tax on EBIT = EBIT * 25%
**NOPLAT**
- NOPLAT = EBIT - Tax on EBIT
- NOPLAT margin =  NOPLAT / Sales
- New Invested Capital = 1000 (fixed value) - depreciation - Capex & ΔWCap
- RONIC = NOPLAT / New Invested Capital
**Cash Flow**
- NOPLAT = defined
- Depreciation = defined
- Capex & ΔWCap = -(depreciation)
- **FCF** = sum(NOPLAT + Depreciation + Capex & ΔWCap)
**NPV**
- WACC = defined (8%)
- Discount factor = 1 / (1+8%)
- Present value = discount factor * present value

## Acquisitions
- Majority of acquisitions (possibly up to two-thirds) destroy or  create no value for bidder's shareholders. Potential reasons:
	- Merger benefits paid to target's shareholders / winner's curse.
	- Merger costs are often under-estimated.
	- Merger activity often occurs at the top of the cycle
