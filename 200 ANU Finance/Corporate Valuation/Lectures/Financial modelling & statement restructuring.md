#### Overview of Company Models & Assignment

**What is a Company Model?**
- A company model is a representation of the financial accounts, designed so it can be filled right with forecasts.
- Output might include:
	- Cash flows & other items (E.G., EPS) to perform valuation analysis
	- Growth rates
	- Return on capital
- Accounting identities should be implicit in the cell links & formulas, i.e., balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement are all integrated; accounts should balance.

##### Assignment - First Part
**Assignment Objectives**:
1. Build a company model, using "KGW Model" as a template.
2. Generate some sensible forecasts
3. Use the model to do a DCF valuation
4. Write-up the **notes** to your mode (any formats that work for you, don't worry about the appearance).

**Tasks to complete**
- Input the historical accounting data
- Decide how to structure the model to support analysis of the company
- Build forecasts
#### Overview of the KGW Valuation Model
##### What the KGW Model Provides
- A place to input historical accounts
- Collects forecasts for major line items (revenues, capex, etc).
- Organises forecasts into integrated set of financial statements
- Summaries forecasts into free cash flows, NOPLAT, etc.
- Calculates a DCF valuation

##### What the KGW Model Lacks
- Delve into forecast drivers (e.g., revenue driven only by % change)
- Analysis by business segments
- Estimation of cost of capital
- Some things need to be custom-built (e.g., DCF diagnostic charts, analysis of investment options, valuation of non-operating businesses)

#### General Advice on Structuring Company Model

##### General Advice
- Modelling is art as well as science
- Models need to be tailored. One size does not fit all.
