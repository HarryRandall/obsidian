##### What is Value?
- **Rule 1**
	- Value = net present value of future cash flows
- **Rule 2**
	- All valuation methods ultimately come back to Rule 1
	- Valuation methods are only valid as they are somehow linked to the net present value of future cash flows.
##### Valuation Approaches
1. Multiple-based valuation: Capitalisation of near-term earnings or cash flow (E.G., PE)
2. Asset-based valuations (adding up individual company assets)
3. Net present value (or discounted cash flow) techniques

**General comments**:
- Each approach has strengths and weaknesses
- Arguments for a composite of valuation indicators
- Why does the course start with DCF?
	- This is the method that is most closely linked to **Rule 1**.

##### A way of thinking about company value
1. A company generates an (**uncertain**) stream of cash flows from its **existing operations**. The value of such operations is the NPV of these cash flows.
	- If a company can get more net cash flow out of its existing operations, the company will be worth more.
	- Need to account for cash reinvested to maintain operations.
	- If the cost of capital falls, the business is also worth more.
2. Additional value is created if the company can invest in new projects earning above the cost of capital.
	- 'True' growth stocks have access to such opportunities.
		- Young companies get value from the additional value that **could** be created.
		- **Amazon** had negative cash flows, but there is potential additional cash flows. These companies are called 'Growth Stocks'
	- Investments that earn below cost of capital will destroy value, regardless of what happens to top-line sales growth.
