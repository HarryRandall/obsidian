## Main Purpose
- View your valuation as the most likely outcome within a distribution of possibilities (and not as a point estimate)
- Sensitivity and scenario analysis both help gauge that distribution
- Share prices are driven by changes in expectations. Use your company model to focus on:
	- What matters?
		- Identify important potential sources of change.
	- How much?
		- Identify important potential sources of change.
	- How much?
		- Magnitude of impact on value and hence price.
	- Any skew?
		- Upside versus downside potential

## Examining Model Mechanics
*Two Perspectives*:
1. Checking internal consistency of the model - Does output change as expected when you plug in different numbers? Direction? Magnitude
**Note:** Examine diagnostics like ROIC and ROIC drivers; not just the end valuation.
2. Understanding sensitivity to key assumptions - Find out what matters most for both cash flows and your valuation.
**Ask yourself:** Does it make sense to have such sensitivity in my model? Should I do anything about it.

## Develop Sensible Sensitivity Analysis
**Possible targets for sensitivity analysis:**
1. Revenue Growth - response to change in key drivers
2. Key costs / margins - Response to change in main inputs
3. Investment required - capital spending, working capital, etc
4. Continuing value - assumed value creation beyond forecasts
5. Cost of capital inputs - beta, ERP, perhaps cost of debt
6. Capital structure - impact of deviating from assumed gearing
7. Currency sensitivity - if relevant

## Examining Model Mechanics
- Traps to avoid
	- Sensitivity analysis of an arbitrary selection of variables without considering their correlations - feasibility of your assumptions are overlooked in modelling.
	- **Example:** Increase EBITDA margin by 5%.
		- Where is it from? Higher price or lower cost of goods sold?
		- Or less expenditure on marketing and sales that drive market awareness and penetration rate?
		- What about revenue?
		- Competitor's response?
	- Another play with the data - Conduct analysis but fail to gain any insights of the model sensitivity
	- You don't want to fail to act on the sensitivity analysis results. If you find any problems with the model, you can fix it.

## Scenario Analysis - Overview
- Your baseline model and resulting valuation reflects your current view of the company outlook, i.e. "what is expected".
- Form scenarios by asking "what could also be?"
- Scenarios might be used to gauge upside and downside, and perhaps form a probability-weighted valuation.
- Scenarios should reflect another plausible state of the world; not mechanical examination of a parameter range. Consider aspect like the trade-offs, competitive response, and so on.
- Scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis are not exclusive to each other.

## Scenario Analysis - An initial Teaser
- **Industry Structure** - What if the industry becomes more or less competitive due to new entrants, over-expansion, corporate action, rationalisation, or management shifts?
- **Game theory** - How could the game change? For instance, what if the government or regulatory backdrop is up-ended?
- **Technological change** - What if technology lowers costs or barriers to entry? Effects on prices, demand, ROIC?
- **Growth** - What if the company decides to expand aggressively?
- **Funding-related** - what if access to capital dries up? Does this feed back into the operations? Is bankruptcy plausible?

## Evaluating Estimates - Example

## Candidates for Scenario Analysis
- Expansion of business into new markets or products
	- What have the management of the company been talking about?
	- Are they actively trying to reveal new products to the market?
	- You can conduct your story this way.
- Change in product penetration or market share
- Corporate transactions that could add or subtract value, e.g. major acquisitions, divestments, change in capital structure.
- Shifts in industry structure or competitiveness, e.g. new entrant
- Regulatory change
- Impact of new technology
- Economic scenarios, e.g. boom/bust
- Fluctuations in major input costs, including the industry response
- Cost of capital changes, or funding pressures.

## Implications for Assignment
- Scenario analysis is a compulsory part of your company model.
- Inclusion of sensitivity is optional, but will be worth additional marks and can enhance your investments case
- What you might do - always link the scenarios to value drivers
	- Identify any relevant scenarios, and provide analysis of upside potential and/or downside risk around your valuation.
	- Provide a table of raw sensitivities to key inputs, plus a summary paragraph highlighting key inputs.
- Overlap is possible between scenarios and investment opportunities
- Probability-weighted valuation is operation. (You might prefer to focus on the distribution, rather than a measure of central tendency)

## Traps to avoid
- Take a simple or "naive" view of scenarios
- **Example:** define different states of economic growth but fail to disclose the relation between drivers and value TLS vs WOW, same drivers?
- Define the company's scenarios (strategies and operations) in isolation
- **Example:** upside and downside market share forecasts but fail to incorporate competitiors reactions
- Define the scenarios around one or two variables, instead of defining a valuation case.
