### Review Questions

1. You are valuing DistressCo, a company struggling to hold market share. The company currently generates $120 million in revenue but is expected to shrink to $100 million next year. Cost of sales currently equals $90 million, and depreciation equals $18 million. Working capital equals $36 million, and equipment equals $120 million. Using these data, construct operating-profit and invested-capital figures for the current year. You decide to build an as-is valuation of DistressCo. To do this, you forecast each ratio (such as cost of sales to revenues) at its current level. Based on this forecast method, what are operating profits and invested capital expected to be next year? What are two critical operating assumptions (identify one for profits and one for capital) embedded in this forecast method?

- You want to create ratios for all of the values, i.e., cost of sales/ revenue. Then you can multiply those values against the forecasted value.
- Asset sale needs to be modelled with the tax implications.

2. You decide to value a steady-state company using probability-weighted scenario analysis. In scenario 1, NOPLAT is expected to grow at 6 percent, and ROIC equals 16 percent. In scenario 2, NOPLAT is expected to grow at 2 percent, and ROIC equals 8 percent. Next year’s NOPLAT is expected to equal $100 million, and the weighted average cost of capital is 10 percent. Using the key value driver formula introduced in Chapter 2, what is the enterprise value in each scenario? If each scenario is equally likely, what is the enterprise value for the company?

- Do each scenario analysis
$$\text{EnterpriseValue} = \frac{NOPLAT (1-\frac{g}{ROIC}}{WACC - g}$$
- Creating value with higher growth will result in higher value

3. A colleague recommends a shortcut to value the company in Question 2. Rather than compute each scenario separately, the colleague recommends averaging each input, such that growth equals 4 percent and ROIC equals 12 percent. Will this lead to the same enterprise value as you found in Question 2? Which method is correct? Why?

- Valuation is not a linear function, you cannot average the inputs to determine the expected value.
- Each input must be calculated specifically to that scenario, and enterprise value must be tied to the individual inputs.
- Therefore, Question 2 leads to the correct valuation, not Question 3.

4. Consumer Products Co reports growth by segment in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” section of its annual report (shown here in Exhibit 15.6, Part A) for a given year. For this year, does each segment have the same organic growth characteristics? As an approximation, set organic growth equal to the sum of volume excluding acquisitions, price, and other. Based on growth by segment, can Consumer Products Co be valued as a whole, or should individual segments be valued separately?

- Adding up the organic growth, styling + refinement + medical
