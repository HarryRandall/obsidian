Chapter 1
## Question 1
What are the total returns to shareholders (TRS), and why is this measure important

- Total Return to Shareholders represents the return earned by shareholders from distributions and increases in share price. This measure is important because managers focus on it, their interests and the interest of shareholders tend to be more aligned.
## Question 2
What is the expectations treadmill, and how does it affect managers' ability to deliver above-average TRS over long periods of time?

- The expectations treadmill refers to the fact that recent growth builds expectations of future growth. The efforts by managers to constantly grow earnings to meet expectations of maintaining the most recent performance effectively put them on a type of treadmill, which can be detrimental to the TRS if the managers grow the company without keeping the ROIC above the cost of capital or if they make unnecessary acquisitions that do not create value.
## Question 3
What are the potential reasons why TRS over short periods of time may not reflect the actual performance of a company and its management?

- A well-performing company may not deliver a high TRS if the expectations incldue knowledge of the performance. This circumstance relates to the adage that a good company may not be a good stock, or the notion that a well-run company builds expectations that this will continue, making the current stock price fully reflect this information.
	- Also, when TRS is analysed in its traditional way, it does not show the degree to which improvements in operations produced or increased the TRS.
	- Finally, outside factors such as changing interest rates can affect TRS and be unrelated to the firm's operations.

## Question 4
What actions (good and bad) might managers take when investors have already high expectations and managers desire to outperform peers on TRS?

- Bad actions by managers include any perverse action to increase the share price without increasing value. These actions could include firing workers or creating artificial hype that does not create value. 
- Good actions generally include pursuing two goals: increasing ROIC and, if ROIC is greater than the cost of capital, increasing growth.

Chapter 5
## Question 1
Explain how long-term price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in the US stock market of around 15 times are consistent with long-term expected stock returns of around 6 to 7 percent a year in real terms.

- Assuming a constant growth rate in earnings and a constant return on capital, the returns to  shareholders are composed of a cash yield plus the growth rate in earnings. If the P/E gravitates to 15, then the earnings yield is 1/15 = 6.7%. If half of this is paid out to shareholders, then the cash yield is 3.35%. If corporate profits continue to grow at 3 to 3.5 percent per year, then summing these two components yields about a 6.5 percent average return.

$\frac{P}{E} = 15$
$\text{Earnings Yield} = \frac{1}{P/E} = \frac{1}{15} = 6.7\%$
$\text{Cash Yield} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6.7\% = 3.35\%$
$\text{profit grows at } 3-3.5\%$
$\text{TRS} = 3.35\% + (3\% \text{till} 3.5\%)$
$= 6.35\% \text{ till } 6.5\%$

## Question 2
Many coporate executives focus on earnings per share (EPS) and attempt to manage reported earnings in order to meet analysts' expecations. Can managers succeed in protecting the stock price of their company by managing these accounts? Why or why not?

- Companies attempt to manage earnings by timing the recognition of revenues and costs or by using gimmicks such as selling assets or introducing customer incentives. Researchers have found that the stock market is not very concerned with earnings volatility and sees through attempts to meet expectations. Thus, efforts to protect the stock price through such efforts will not pay off over the long term.

## Question 3
If a company's value is not driven by its short-term earnings, why do investors spend so much time analysis a company's annual or even quarterly earnings announcements?

- Although investors place more importance on a company’s economic fundamentals than on reported earnings, sometimes short-term earnings are the only data investors have on which to base their judgment of fundamental corporate performance. Investors may view an EPS that is below expectations as an omen of a decline in long-term performance and management credibility, which will lower share price. Management must then convince the investors that the poor short-term earnings do not reflect the long-term profitability or growth.

## Question 4
Empirical research shows that goodwill impairments have no impact on a company's share price. But these impairments do reflect an auditor's best estimate of the value lost in an acquisition by the company. Does the stock market not care about such losses? Explain.

- Investors care about goodwill impairment only if the adjustment reflects lower-than-expected benefits from the acquisition that have not already been reflected in the stock price. When an auditor determines that there is a need for an adjustment in goodwill, the investors already know the loss in value from the acquisition. When the actual impairment is made on the statements, in other words, the price of the stock has already incorporated the essential information, and there is no reaction in the market.

## Question 5
In inflationary periods for input prices, what happens to earnings when firms change from first-in-first-out (FIFO) to last-in-first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting? How does the market reach? Why is this the case?

- Changing from first-in first-out (FIFO) to last-in first-out (LIFO) inventory reduces profits during inflationary times, as the more recent (expensive) inventory is expensed. However, this will increase free cash flows in the near term, as the firm experiences lower taxes. The positive market reaction is consistent with this result.

## Question 6
As a rule, cross-listings for companies with a home listing in a mature capital market do not offer material benefits. Discuss how and why this might be different for companies based in merging capital markets.

- The potential benefits from cross-listing are an increase in analyst coverage, a broader shareholder base, improved liquidity, improved corporate governance, and better access to capital. These benefits would most likely be the largest and have an effect on the price for a company that was originally listed in an emerging market and then is cross-listed in a more developed market. The benefits are likely to be much lower or nonexistent for a stock listed in a developed market and then cross-listed in another market.

## Question 7
Over the past five years, the highest share price for HighTechCo, a 15-year-old software company, was around $650, and its lowest price was around $150. BrandaCo, a consumer products firm with 70-year history, had share prices ranging from $85 down to $40 oer the same period. Do such wide ranges mean that the stock market is reflecting emotions more than fundaments? Explain.

- The wider swings in price for a stock such as HighTechCo when compared with BrandCo can be explained as a rational reaction to fundamentals. HighTechCo is a newer company in a more cutting-edge and uncertain industry. Swings in the prices reflect changes in expectations concerning the company and its industry, and the range in expectations is likely to be wider for HighTechCo than for an established company such as BrandCo.
