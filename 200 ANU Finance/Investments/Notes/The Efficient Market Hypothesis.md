## 1. Random walk

- Which of the following reflects a better functioning stock market?  
	- A market where the stock prices are perfectly predictable  
	- A market where the stock prices move randomly ✓  

**Random walk:**  
- The changes in stock price are random and cannot be predicted  
- Any predictable changes will be exploited immediately  
- Reflected into the current stock price  

---

## 2. Efficient market hypothesis

**Efficient market hypothesis (EMH)**
> A financial market is (informationally) efficient when market prices reflect all available information about security value
- Security prices should fully reflect all available information  
- New information should be incorporated into security prices in an instantaneous and unbiased manner  

- About “**efficient**”  
	- Risk-return efficient: best $E(r)$ for a given risk (efficient frontier)  
	- Informationally efficient: current price is right  

---

## 2. Efficient market hypothesis

- Security prices should fully reflect all available information  
- Three forms of efficient market hypothesis (EMH), Fama 1970  

	- Weak form: prices reflect past price information (e.g., technical analysis does not generate abnormal return)  
	- Semi-strong form: prices reflect all publicly available information (e.g., fundamental analysis does not generate abnormal return)  
	- Strong form: prices reflect all publicly and privately available information, including past and present (e.g., insider trading does not generate abnormal return.)

## 2. Efficient market hypothesis

- New information should be incorporated into security prices in an instantaneous and unbiased manner  

**Example:**  
> Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was approved by FDA on August 10, 2021. How should the share price of Pfizer react to this news?  

  - Increase immediately to a new equilibrium level (efficient market reaction)  
  - Increase gradually to the new equilibrium (under-reaction)  
  - First over-shoot and then settle back to new equilibrium level (over-reaction)

## 2. Efficient market hypothesis

- In an efficient market:  
	- Security prices should fully reflect all available information  
	- Any new information should be incorporated into security prices instantaneously in an unbiased way  
	- Information drives price changes  
	- New information is unpredictable, so changes in prices are also unpredictable  
	- Therefore, stock price changes should follow a random walk  

- Investing in an efficient market:  
  - Does not mean that you cannot make money  
  - Only earn a risk premium that is compensation for the market risks  
  - No bias in prices that can be exploited to earn abnormal returns

## 3. Empirical tests of EMH (weak form)

(1) Weak form EMH: prices reflect past information  

> Empirical evidence  

- ✓ Technical analysis trading are not consistently profitable  
- ✓ Serial correlations in daily stock returns are close to zero  
- ✗ Momentum:  
  - Past winners (losers) continue to win (lose) in near future  
  - Over long-term, momentum reversal is an indication of over-reaction  

---
## 3. Empirical tests of EMH (semi-strong form)

(2) Semi-strong form EMH: prices reflect all publicly available information, including past and present  

Empirical evidence  

- Asset pricing anomalies (size, value, etc.)  
- Publicly available risk factors are able to explain most stock returns (e.g. Fama-French 3-factor model)  
- Prices react to news quickly and unbiased (event studies)  

Examples: earnings announcements, stock splits, mergers and acquisitions, FDA approval of vaccines, etc.  

---

## 3. Empirical tests of EMH (semi-strong form)

- Issues with anomalies and semi-strong EMH  

1. Anomalies like size, value, etc. arise because  
   - Evidence against market efficiency, or  
   - Just risk-factors and market is efficient  

2. Joint-hypothesis issue of testing  
   - A significant alpha means market is inefficient, or  
   - Maybe the model used is imperfect  

---

## 3. Empirical tests of EMH (semi-strong form)

- Event study:  
  - Investigate the impact of a certain event on stock prices (returns)  
  - Based on a benchmark (asset pricing models)  

Steps:  
1. Regression to estimate $\beta$ of a stock using returns before the event  
2. Predict returns around event  
3. Abnormal return = observed return - model predicted return  
4. Cumulate abnormal returns through event window  
5. Repeat over all stocks with the same event  
6. Analyze CAR pattern  

---

## 3. Empirical tests of EMH (strong form)

(3) Strong form EMH: prices reflect all publicly and privately available information, including past and present  

Empirical evidence  

- Whether insiders profit from inside information?  
- Insider trading is heavily regulated  
- Australian laws prohibit trading on non-public, material information  

---

## 4. What makes market efficient?

- Public information:  
	- Trade on it to correct mispricing  

- Private information:  
	- Analyst research  
	- Example: satellites predicting oil price changes  

- Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox:  
	- If market is strong form efficient, no incentive to gather info  
	- If no one gathers info, how is it reflected in prices?  
	- Market unlikely to be strong-form efficient  

---

## 5. Behavioural finance

- Asset pricing anomalies:  
  - Some portfolios mispriced relative to models  
  - Mispricing persists  

- Explanations:  
  - Missing systematic risks  
  - Current models insufficient  
  - Investors may not be rational  

- Key ideas:  
  - Information processing errors and biases  
  - Behavioral biases  
  - Limits of arbitrage  

---

## 6. Information processing errors and biases

- Investors don’t always process information correctly  
- Examples:  
	- Extrapolation and pattern recognition  
	- Limited attention  
	- Overreaction  
	- Underreaction  
	- Overconfidence  
	- Conservatism  

---

## 6. Information processing errors and biases

1. Extrapolation and pattern recognition  
	- Sample size neglect  
	- Generalising small samples  

2. Limited attention  
	- Decisions based on headlines or heuristics  
	- Social media exacerbates this  

3. Over-reaction / Under-reaction  
![[Pasted image 20250916122522.png]]

4. Overconfidence  
   - Overestimate ability and forecast precision  
   - Men trade more actively, perform worse (Barber & Odean 2001)  

5. Conservatism  
   - Slow to update beliefs with new info  

---

## 7. Behavioral biases

- Even with perfect information processing, investors may act irrationally  

Types:  
- Prospect theory (loss-aversion)  
- Regret avoidance  
- Mental accounting  
- Lottery-like behaviour  

---

## 7. Behavioral biases

1. Prospect theory (loss aversion)  
   - Gains vs losses valued differently  
   - Willingness to take more risk to avoid loss  
   - Example: not selling losing stocks  

2. Regret avoidance  
   - Fear of regret drives poor decisions  

3. Mental accounting  
   - Assigning subjective values to money for different purposes  
   - Leads to inconsistent decisions  

4. Lottery-like behaviour  
   - Some stocks resemble lottery tickets  
   - Risk-seeking behaviour despite negative expected return  

---

## 8. Limits of arbitrage

- Arbitrage strategies restricted in practice  
- Limits:  
  - Market frictions (transaction costs, fees, illiquidity)  
  - Model risk  
  - Unfavourable price movements, margin calls  
  - Irrational crowds (e.g., GME short squeeze)  
  - Sudden government intervention  

---

## 8. Behavioral finance

- Remarks:  
  - Only major behavioural stories covered  
  - Biases often appear together  
  - Important in finance and investments  
  - Debate continues: anomalies due to risk factors or behavioural biases  
  - Growing research in behavioural finance and neuroscience
