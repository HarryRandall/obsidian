##### Calculating Returns
- "Buy-and-hold" investment
- The **holder period return** ("HPR") is a measure of the return earned over a given period. Basically just a % return of the investment.
$$HPR_t = \frac{P_t + D_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$$
- $P_t$ is investment value at the end of the holding period.
- $P_t-1$ is initial investment value
- $D_t$ is the investment income such as dividend

- Implicity assumes investment income is received at the end of the holding period.
- Called as "realised return" if it has happened
- Let's denote this one period return as $r$ 

Now assume we have a sample of returns over multiple $T$ periods for a single asset $(r_1, r_2, r_3,...,r_T)$.
- Average returns over time (time-series).
**Arithmetic average return**:
$$
\bar{r} = \frac{1}{T} (r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_T) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t
$$
**Geometric average return**:
$$
r_G = \left[ (1 + r_1)(1 + r_2) \cdots (1 + r_T) \right]^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1
$$
###### Example 1

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Year} & \text{Return} \\
\hline
2018 & - \\
2019 & 5\% \\
2020 & 9\% \\
2021 & -5\% \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
- Arithmetic average return
$$
\bar{r} = \frac{1}{3} (0.05 + 0.09 - 0.05) = 3\%
$$
- Geometric average return
$$
r_G = \left[(1 + 0.05)(1 + 0.09)(1 - 0.05)\right]^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 = 2.8\%
$$
###### Example 2
- A more extreme example
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Time} & \text{Value} & \text{Return} \\
\hline
0 & \$1{,}000 & - \\
1 & \$2{,}000 & 100\% \\
2 & \$1{,}000 & -50\% \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
- Arithmetic average return
$$
= \frac{(100 - 50)}{2} = 25\%
$$
- Geometric average return
$$
= \left[(1 + 100\%) \times (1 - 50\%)\right]^{\frac{1}{2}} - 1 = 0\%
$$
- In practices (time-series):
    - Geometric average is better to evaluate past performance
    - Arithmetic average is better to make a return prediction next period
    - Will be specified clearly in exams

##### Class Assumptions
- Returns are annualised and compounded annually.
- Effective Annual Rates
- No interest rate conversions.

##### Real Return
- Purchasing power varies overtime due to inflation
- Sometimes, need to adjust return (i) in the returns
- A common measure of inflation is the growth rate of the CPI

##### Expected Return and Standard Deviation
- So far we have been calculating risks under certainty
- Return is not certain (unless it's risk free like a government bond).
- Calculating the Expected Return
$$E(r) = \sum_s Pr(s)r(s)$$
- Calculating Standard Deviation
$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sqrt{\sum_s Pr(s)[r(s)-E(r)]^2}$$
- Where $Pr(s)$ is the probability of scenarios occuring
- $r(s)$ is the return of a given scenario

###### Example
- Each share of stock A is currently $100, and a cash dividend of $4 is paid in one year
- Stock A has the following possible outcomes over the next year:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

\hline

\text{Scenario} & \text{Probability} & \text{Ending price} & \text{HPR} \\

\hline

\text{Good} & 0.35 & \$140 & 44\% \\

\text{Normal} & 0.30 & \$110 & 14\% \\

\text{Bad} & 0.35 & \$80 & -16\% \\

\hline

\end{array}
$$

Expected return and standard deviation:
$$E(r) = [0.35 \times 44\%] + [0.30 \times 14\%] + [0.35 \times (-16\%)] = 14\%$$
$$\sigma^2 = [0.35 \times (44\% - 14\%)^2] + [0.30 \times (14\% - 14\%)^2] + [0.35 \times (-16\% - 14\%)^2] = 0.63$$
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2} = 25.10\%$$
In practice, we can't observe the expectations directly, and we have to use historical data instead.

- Stock returns are (approximately) normally distributed
- Investment management is more manageable when returns can be well approximated by the normal distribution.
	- Symmetric and stable
	- Only mean and standard deviation are needed.

##### Return Distributions
- If return distributions is positively skewed, $\sigma$ will overestimate risk.
- If return distributions is negatively skewed, $\sigma$ will underestimate risk.
- If return distributions exhibits "fat tails", $\sigma$ will underestimate the likelihood of extreme gains and losses.
