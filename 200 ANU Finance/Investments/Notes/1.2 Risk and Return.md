##### Calculating Returns
- "Buy-and-hold" investment
- The holder period return ("HPR") is a measure of the return earned over a given period. Basically just a % return of the investment.
$$HPR_t = \frac{P_t + D_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}$$
- $P_t$ is investment value at the end of the holding period.
- $P_t-1$ is initial investment value
- $D_t$ is the investment income such as dividend

- Implicity assumes investment income is received at the end of the holding period.
- Called as "realised return" if it has happened
- Let's denote this one period return as $r$ 

Now assume we have a sample of returns over multiple $T$ periods for a single asset $(r_1, r_2, r_3,...,r_T)$.
- Average returns over time (time-series).
**Arithmetic average return**:
$$
\bar{r} = \frac{1}{T} (r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_T) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t
$$
**Geometric average return**:
$$
r_G = \left[ (1 + r_1)(1 + r_2) \cdots (1 + r_T) \right]^{\frac{1}{T}} - 1
$$
###### Example 1

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Year} & \text{Return} \\
\hline
2018 & - \\
2019 & 5\% \\
2020 & 9\% \\
2021 & -5\% \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

- Arithmetic average return
$$
\bar{r} = \frac{1}{3} (0.05 + 0.09 - 0.05) = 3\%
$$
- Geometric average return
$$
r_G = \left[(1 + 0.05)(1 + 0.09)(1 - 0.05)\right]^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1 = 2.8\%
$$

###### Example 2
- A more extreme example
$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Time} & \text{Value} & \text{Return} \\
\hline
0 & \$1{,}000 & - \\
1 & \$2{,}000 & 100\% \\
2 & \$1{,}000 & -50\% \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
- Arithmetic average return
$$
= \frac{(100 - 50)}{2} = 25\%
$$
- Geometric average return
$$
= \left[(1 + 100\%) \times (1 - 50\%)\right]^{\frac{1}{2}} - 1 = 0\%
$$
- In practices (time-series):
    - Geometric average is better to evaluate past performance
    - Arithmetic average is better to make a return prediction next period
    - Will be specified clearly in exams
