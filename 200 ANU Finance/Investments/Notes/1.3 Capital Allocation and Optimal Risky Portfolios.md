#### Lecture
##### Risk preference and risk aversion
- Risk averse investors don't like risk
- It doesn't mean that they won't take on a risky investment
- But they want to be compensated by a higher expected return
- A trade-off between risk and return ($\sigma$ and $E(r)$)

- Quantify the risk-return trade-off using utility functions
$$U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2}A \sigma^2$$
##### Definitions
- **Market Risk**
	- Market-wide risk sources (affect all securities)
	- Remains even after diversification
	- Also called as systematic / non-diversifiable risk
- **Firm-specific risk**
	- Risk sources related to a certain film or industry
	- Can be eliminated by diversification
	- Also called non-systematic / diversifiable / idiosyncratic risk

##### Diversification
![[Pasted image 20250805112101.png]]

- The most stocks you have, the lower the risk that you have.
- There is still the **systematic risk** from the market.
##### One Risky Asset
##### Two Risky Assets
- A portfolio of two risky assets, $A$ and $B$
	- Expected returns $E(r_A)$ and $E(r_B)$
	- Risks $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$
	- Weights $W_A$ and $W_B$, where $W_A + W_B = 1$
	- $W_A$ or $W_B$, can be negative if short selling allowed
	- $W_A$ and $W_B$, affect portfolio's expected return and risk
	- The correlation between $A$ and $B$ ($p_{AB})$ affects portfolio's risk.

- Portfolio return equals weighted asset return
$$ R_P = W_A r_A + W_B r_B$$
- The expected return on a portfolio of two risk assets
$$ E(r_P) = W_A E(r_A) + W_B E(r_B)$$
- The risk of the portfolio
$$\sigma_P = \sqrt {{W_A^2}{\sigma_A^2} + {W_B^2}{\sigma_B^2} + 2 {W_A}{W_B}p_{AB}{\sigma_A}{\sigma_B}}$$
- Where
	- $p_{AB} \in \; [-1, 1]$ is the correlation between the returns

- The risk of the portfolio
$$\sigma_P = \sqrt {{W_A^2}{\sigma_A^2} + {W_B^2}{\sigma_B^2} + 2 {W_A}{W_B}p_{AB}{\sigma_A}{\sigma_B}} \equiv W_A \sigma_A + W_B \sigma_B$$
	- $\sigma_P$ is less than the simple weighted average risk if $p_{AB} < 1$
	- Benefits of diversification.

![[Pasted image 20250805113335.png]]
- Investment (portfolio) opportunity set
- $P_{AB} = 1$, there is no diversification
- $P_{AB} < 1$, there is benefit of diversification, $\sigma_P < W_A \sigma_A + W_B \sigma_B$
- $P_{AB} = -1$, a perfect hedge is possible.
- Optimal risky portfolio depends on risk aversion (indifference curves)

- **Minimum Variance Portfolio**
$${W_B^{min} = 1 - W{_A^{min}}}$$
- Note that the minimum variance portfolio is not necessary.

##### Many Risk Assets
- A portfolio of many risk assets, $i = 1,2,...,n$
- Expected returns $E(r_i), E(r_2),...,E(r_n)$
- Risks $\sigma_i = \sigma_1, \sigma_2,...,\sigma_n$
- $N \times N$ matrix of pairwise correlations
- Weights $w_i = w_1, w_2,...,w_n, where {\sum{^n_{i=1}} w_i = 1}$   

- The risk of the portfolio
$$ \sigma_P = \sqrt{\sum{^n_{i=1}}{\sum{^n_{j=1}} W_iW_j\;p_{ij} \; \sigma_i \sigma_j}} $$
- In total: N variance terms + $\frac {N^2-N}{2}$ covariance items.

- We can express portfolio variance as
$$ {\sigma^{2}_{p}} = (\frac{1}{n}) \bar{\sigma}^2 + (\frac{n-1}{n}) {\bar{Cov}}$$
- Where
	- $\bar{\sigma}^2$ is the average variance
	- ${\bar{Cov}}$ is the average covariance
- The benefits of diversification for many risky assets
	- The first item can be diversified with large numbers of risky assets
	- The covariance component cannot be diversified
	- The risk of a highly diversified portfolio depends on the covariance.

- The risk reduction of equally weighted portfolios
- Universe Size N = Number of assets
- Portfolio weight, how much of your portfolio it makes up.
- Assume standard deviation of one asset is 50%
- If the correlation $p$ is $40\%$, the portfolio $\sigma$ reduces, but at a much smaller rate (diversification).

- Efficient frontier provides the best risk-return combinations.
	- People like to invest in the portfolios that are in the top half.
	- For any level or risk, these gives you the highest return
- **Global Minimum Variance Portfolio** is the lowest point in the efficient frontier. 
- Each dot represents a different portfolio
- All the possibilities are illustrated by the efficient frontier, all portfolios will be on the RHS.

- We can construct many portfolios with different risk and return
- **Minimum-variance frontier**
	- A collection of portfolios that offer the lowest $\sigma_P$ for a given $E(r_P)$
	- Individual assets appear to the right inside of the frontier.
- **Global minimum-variance portfolio** has the minimum variance among all possible portfolios.

- **Efficient frontier**
	- The portion of the minimum-variance frontier that lies above and to the right of the global minimum variance portfolio
	- Portfolios on efficient frontier are possible optimal risky portfolio
	- Selection of optimal risk portfolio depends on the degree of risk aversion (indifference curves).

- A particular risk averse investor choose optimal risky portfolio on efficient frontier based on indifference curves.
![[Pasted image 20250805120302.png]]
- If there are two points that touch the indifference curve, we can raise the indifference curve to get a higher utility.
	- If it touches two indifference curves, it's not optimal.
	- Should be tangent to one point

##### One Risky Asset and a risk-free asset
- So far we have been focusing on risky assets
- Extend the analysis with the presence of risk-free asset
	- Government bonds
	- Broad range of money market instruments
- Capital allocation
	- Most basic asset allocation decision
	- How much to invest in the risky versus risk-free asset
- A **complete portfolio** (C), with $E(r_C)$, $\sigma_C$, includes
	- Fraction $y$ in a risk asset / portfolio ($P$), with $E(r_P$), $\sigma_P$
	- Fraction 1- $y$ in a risk-free asset (F), with $r_f$, $\sigma_f$, (where $\sigma_f = 0$)


- The expected return of the complete portfolio
$$E(r_C) = r_f + y[E(r_P) - r)f]$$
- The standard deviation of the complete portfolio
$$\sigma_C = y \sigma_P$$
- Which implies
$$E(r_C) = [\frac{E(r_P)-r_f}{\sigma_P}] \sigma_C$$

- The higher the sharpe ratio / slope of the line, the better risk return ratio
- **Sharpe Ratio** - $[\frac{E(r_P)-r_f}{\sigma_P}]$ William Sharpe, Nobel prize winner.

- Capital allocation line (CAL)
	- All possible $E(r_C)$ and $\sigma_C$ combinations of complete portfolios consisting of one risky asset/portfolio and a risk free asset.
	- The slope of CAL is the increase in the complete portfolio's expected return for each additional unity of standard deviation
	- Reward-to-variability ratio (**Sharpe ratio**)
$$slope = \frac{E(r_P)-r_f}{\sigma_P}$$
- Every point on the CAL has the same **Sharpe ratio**, i.i., Sharpe ratio doesn't change with leverage.
- Chose optimal complete portfolio on CAL based investor risk aversion.


##### Many Risky Assets and a risk-free asset
- The **optimal CAL** is the tangent line with the efficient frontier
- It has the highest Sharpe ratio among all feasible CALs
$$E(r_C) =  r_f + [\frac{E(r_P)-r_f}{\sigma_P}] \sigma_C$$
- The tangent point $P$ is the optimal risky potfolio.

##### Markowitz Portfolio Theory
- Summarise Markowitz Portfolio Theory
- A portfolio consisting of many risky assets and a risk-free asset

	1) Identify the risk-return combinations available from the risky assets
	2) Identify the optimal risky portfolio by finding the portfolio weights that result in the steepest CAL (highest Sharpe ratio)
		1) Capital Allocation
	3) Choose an appropriate complete portfolio by mixing the risk free asset with the optimal risky portfolio.
##### Capital Market Line (CML)
- Market portfolio
	- All the investors hold the same optimal risky portfolio
	- Must be the most diversified risky portfolio
	- Must be the collection of all risky assets
	- The weight of each risk asset is its market value / total market value
- Capital market line (CML)
- Theoretical foundation for CAPM
