##### What is investment?
- The current commitment of money or resources in the expectation of receiving future benefits.
- An investment involves:
  - Foregoing consumption of wealth today and investing it with the hope of generating further funds for future consumption.
  - Placing this wealth in **real assets** or **financial assets** that are expected to earn returns in the future.
  - Giving up consumption today in order to increase future consumption, shifting today’s consumption into the future.
  - Assuming a certain level of risk, i.e., a probability that the investment will yield a lower-than-expected return.
- The opposite of investment is consumption, and the economy broadly follows these two main categories.

##### Real Assets
- Used to produce goods and services.
- Examples:
  - Land
  - Buildings
  - Machines
  - Software (not tangible, but still a real asset)
  - Physical commodities

##### Financial Assets
- A contractual claim on the income generated by the **real assets**.
- Do not directly contribute to the productive capacity of the economy.
- Traded in financial markets.
- Allow investment risk to be shared.
- Allow a separation of ownership and control.
  - Even if you own the building, you don’t manage the building.
- Examples:
  - Stocks
  - Bonds (IOUs)
  - Derivatives

##### Portfolios
- When constructing an investment portfolio, investors make two main decisions:
  - **Asset allocation**: choose between broad asset classes:
    - Equities
    - Fixed income
    - Land
    - etc.
  - **Security selection**: within the asset class, which security to invest in (e.g., should I buy AAPL or MSFT?).
- Once initially formed, the portfolio is then periodically rebalanced:
  - Sell existing investments and replace with new ones.
  - Reinvest the income from investments:
    - Dividends
    - Interest
  - Add funds to purchase additional securities.

##### Issue securities
- When firms need to raise capital, they can do so by issuing securities.
- New securities are issued to raise funds in the **primary markets** (i.e., investors face companies directly):  
  - **Public offering**  
    - Initial public offering (IPO)
      - Extensive requirements and regulation
    - Seasoned equity offering (SEO)
  - **Private placement**: lower disclosure requirements but smaller size
- Once issued, securities are bought and sold in **secondary markets** (i.e., investors trade with other investors):  
  - Direct search markets  
  - Brokered markets  
  - Dealer markets  
  - Auction markets

##### Initial public offering (IPO)
- A private firm raises capital from the general public.
- First issue of shares to the public = IPO.
- IPOs (stocks and bonds) are typically marketed by underwriters:
  - **Firm commitment:** underwriter(s) purchase the entire issue at a certain price and resell to the public.
  - **Best efforts:** underwriter(s) commit in good faith to market the securities but take no responsibility for any unsold shares.
- **IPO underpricing**
  - The offering price is commonly underpriced compared to the first-day trading price.
  - Example: average first-day return on Australian IPOs is about $20\%$.
  - Widely studied but still an ongoing research topic.

##### Trade securities
- Once issued, securities are bought and sold in **secondary markets**:  
  - **Direct search markets**  
    - Buyers and sellers must find each other  
    - Search costs
    - Think of direct outreach (e.g., a classifieds marketplace)
  - **Brokered markets**  
    - Brokers search out buyers and sellers  
    - Brokerage fee
  - **Dealer markets**  
    - Dealers hold inventories of assets from which they buy and sell  
    - **Bid–ask spread**
      - **Bid price**: the price at which a buyer is willing to **buy** a security
      - **Ask price**: the price at which a seller is willing to **sell** a security
      - **Bid–ask spread**: the **difference** between the bid and ask prices
      - Bid should be $\leq$ Ask; otherwise the dealer would lose money
  - **Auction markets**  
    - Traders converge to trade in one place (physically or electronically)  
    - Most integrated
- **Exchanges**
  - Centralised venues where buyers and sellers meet
- **Over-the-counter (OTC) markets**
  - Decentralised; participants trade by contacting one another

- Investors execute trades through two types of orders:  
  - **Market order**: a buy or sell order executed immediately at the current market price (i.e., buy at the best ask price and sell at the best bid price).
  - **Price-contingent order (limit order)**: a buy or sell order executed only at a specified price.
  - **Limit order book**: a collection of limit orders waiting to be executed.

###### Example Limit Order Book

Limit Order Book for ANZ Group on ASX Stock Exchange

**Buyers**:
- The “Buyers” side (Bid) lists the prices at which participants want to buy shares.
- Buyer 1 wants to buy $1{,}000$ shares at a bid price of $\$24.61$ per share.
- Buyer 1 also wants to buy another $1{,}000$ shares at $\$24.56$ per share.
- The $\$24.620$ shown is the last recorded sale price. If there is a market order for $1{,}000$ shares to **sell**, the transaction would likely execute at $\$24.61$. A larger sell order (e.g., $20{,}000$ shares) could push the execution down the bid stack, potentially as low as $\$24.45$.

**Sellers**:
- The “Sellers” side (Ask) lists the prices at which participants want to sell shares.

**Market Order**: You tell the broker you want to immediately buy or sell at the best available price.

**E.g.,** You issue a market order to **buy $4{,}000$ shares**. The broker will execute the following orders based on the limit order book:

**Buying Shares** ($4{,}000$ shares):
1. Buy $2{,}539$ shares from Seller 3 at $\$24.67$ per share for a total of $2{,}539 \times \$24.67 = \$62{,}687.91$.  
   ($1{,}461$ shares left to buy)
2. Buy $1{,}405$ shares from Seller 2 at $\$24.68$ per share for a total of $1{,}405 \times \$24.68 = \$34{,}675.40$.  
   ($56$ shares left to buy)
3. Buy $56$ shares from Seller 2 at $\$24.69$ per share for a total of $56 \times \$24.69 = \$1{,}382.64$.  
   ($0$ shares left to buy)

##### Trading Costs
- **Explicit costs**: brokerage commissions, security-lending fees.
- **Implicit costs**: bid–ask spread.
- Historically, the average round-trip trading cost in stocks is around $0.5\%$, but it has been significantly reduced in recent years.

##### Buying on margin
- Borrowing money to buy securities.
- Investors may want to invest an amount greater than their own money.
- Contribute part of the purchase price with own funds.
- Borrow the remainder from a broker (margin loans).
- Must pay interest on the loan.
- Securities purchased with margin are kept with the broker as collateral.
- Greater upside potential but also greater downside risk.
- “Leveraged trading” magnifies risk.

##### Margin Terms
- **Initial margin**: the fraction of the purchase price contributed by the investor when the margin trade is initiated; usually at least $50\%$.  
  E.g., you have $\$100{,}000$ in cash; you can borrow up to $\$100{,}000$ total position with at least $50\%$ equity.
- **Maintenance margin**: the minimum equity that must be kept in the account; depends on brokers but is usually lower than the initial margin.  
  E.g., if your account value drops toward the maintenance threshold, you may receive a margin call.
- Investor will receive a **margin call** if the equity falls below the maintenance margin. You can either deposit more money or the broker may liquidate positions.

##### Example
- At time $T=0$, stock price is $\$100$  
  - Purchase $100$ shares  
  - Initial position $= \$100 \times 100 = \$10{,}000$  
    - Borrowed: $\$4{,}000$  
    - Equity (investor’s own funds): $\$6{,}000$  
  - Initial margin $= \$6{,}000 / \$10{,}000 = 60\%$
- At time $T=1$, stock price drops to $\$70$  
  - New position $= \$70 \times 100 = \$7{,}000$  
    - Borrowed: $\$4{,}000$  
    - Equity (value belonging to investor): $\$3{,}000$  
  - New margin $= \$3{,}000 / \$7{,}000 = 43\%$
- Assume broker requires a maintenance margin of $30\%$  
  - No margin call so far
- Investor will receive a margin call if price falls below $P=\$57.14$:
  $$
  \frac{100 \times P - 4{,}000}{100 \times P} = 30\%
  $$
  $$
  P = \$57.14
  $$
- At this point:  
  - Investors are required to top up the margin account.  
  - If the investor fails to act, the broker may sell securities from the account and reduce the loan enough to restore the maintenance margin.

##### Short selling
- Short selling: profit from a decline in a security’s price.  
- Borrow the security from a lender via a broker or dealer.  
- Sell the borrowed security.  
- Later, **cover** the short position: purchase the equivalent security and return it to the lender.  
- Must pay dividends and other benefits that would have accrued to the lender.  
- A margin account with the broker is required to cover adverse price movements (price increases).  
- Incur lending fees.

    - In the US, the SEC and other agencies administer legislation including the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Dodd–Frank Act.  
  - **Industry bodies**  
    - Securities exchanges and professional bodies such as the CFA Institute.
