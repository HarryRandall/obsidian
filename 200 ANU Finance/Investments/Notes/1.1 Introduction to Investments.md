#### What is investment?
- The current commitment of money or resources in the expectation of receiving future benefits
- An investments involves:
	- Foregoing consumption of wealth today and investing it with the hope of generating further funds for future consumption;
	- Placing this wealth in **real assets** or **financial assets** that are expected to earn returns in the future.
	- You are giving up your consumption today in order to increase your future consumption, shifting todays consumption into the future.
	- Assuming a certain level of risk, or probability that the investment will yield a lower than expected return.
	- The opposite of investments is consumption, and the economy follows these two main categories.

- When someone needs to raise capital, they can do this by issuing securities.

- A private firm wishes to raise capital from general public  
- First issue of shares to general public - IPO  
- IPOs (stocks and bonds) are typically marketed by underwriters  
	- **Firm commitment:** underwriter(s) purchase the entire issue at a  
     certain price and resell to public  
	- **Best efforts**: underwriter(s) commit in good faith to market the  
     securities but take no responsibility on any unsold shares  
- IPO underpricing  
	- The offering price is commonly underpriced compared to the first  
     day trading price

#### Trade securities
- Once issued, securities are bought and sold in secondary markets  
	- **Direct search markets**  
		- Buyers and sellers have to find each other  
		- Searching cost
		- Reaching out directly to the seller / buyer, like FB marketplace

		- Brokerage fee
	- **Dealer markets**  
		- Dealers have inventories of assets from which they buy and sell  
		- Bid-ask spread
			- Bid is what the dealer wants to pay for the item
			- Ask price is what they sell it for
			- They buy a car for 15k, sell it for 25k.
		- **Bid price** is the price at which the buyer is willing to **buy** a security
		- **Ask price** is the price at which the seller is willing to **sell** a security
		- **Bid-ask** spread is the **difference** between the bid and ask prices
		- Bid should be ≤ Ask, otherwise dealer loses $ on trade.
	- **Auction markets**  
		 - Traders converge to trade in one place (physically or electronically)  
		- Most integrated  
- **Exchanges**
	- Physical place, buyer and seller go there together, more centralised.
- **Over-the-counter** markets (OTC)
	- Less direct, need to contact each other.

- Investors execute trade through two types of orders  
	- **Market order**: a buy or sell order that is to be executed immediately  
     at current market price (i.e., buy at the best ask price and sell at  
     the best bid price)
	- **Price-contingent order** (limit order): a buy or sell order only to be  
     executed at a specified price.
	- **Limit order book**: A collection of limit orders waiting to be executed

###### Example Limit Order Book
Limit Order Book for ANZ Group on ASX Stock Exchange

**Buyers**:
- The 'Buyers' side or Bid Price of the table illustrates the price that those people want to buy an issue of stock for.
- Buyer 1 wants to buy 1,000 issues of the share at the bid price of $24.61 per share.
- Buyer 1 also wants to buy another 1,000 issues of shares at $24.56 per share.
- The $\$24.620$ value of the company, is simply the last recorded sales of stock, so if there is a market order for $1,000$ shares, the stock price will drop down to $\$24.61$. If you ask to buy $20,000$ shares, you will push down the market shares to $\$24.45$.
**Sellers**:
- The 'Buyers' side or Ask Price of the table illustrates the price that those people want to sell an issue of stock for.
- 

**Market Order**: You tell the broker you want to immediately sell your shares for the highest bid price available on the market. 

**E.G.,** You issue a market order to buy 3,000 shares, the broker will look at the Limit Order Book and will sell complete the following orders:

**Buying Shares** (4000 shares):
1. $2,539$ shares to Seller 3 at $\$24.67$ per share for a total of $2,539 \times \$24.67 = \$62,687.91$. 
   ($1,461$ shares left to buy)
2. $1,405$ shares to Buyer 2 at \$$24.68$ per share for a total of $1,405 \times \$24.68 = \$34,675.4$.
   ($56$ shares left to buy)
3. $56$ shares to Buyer 2 at $\$24.69$ per share for a total of $56 \times \$24.69 = \$1,382.64$.
   ($0$ shares left to buy)

##### Trading Costs
- Explicit costs: brokerage commissions, security lending fee
- Implicit costs: bid-ask spread
- Historically, the average round-trip trading costs in stocks is around 0.5%, but it's significantly reduced in recent years.

#### Buying on margin
- Borrowing money to buy securities
- Investors may want to invest an amount greater than own money
- Contribute part of the purchase price with own money
- Borrow the reminder from a broker (margin loans)
- Must pay interest on the loan
- Securities purchased with margin are kept with broker as collateral
- Greater upside potential but also expose to greater downside risk
- "Leverage trading" - magnifies the risk

##### Margin Terms
- **Initial Margin** is the fraction of purchase price contributed by investor when the margin trade is imitated. Usually at least 50%. E.G., you have $100,000 in cash, you can only borrow $50,000.
- **Maintenance margin** is the minimum value that must be kept in account, it depends on brokers but usually lower than initial margin. E.G., you now have $150,000 in your account, so if the account balance drops to $60,000, you will get margin called.
- Investor will receive a **margin call** if the value of the securities falls below maintenance margin. You can either put more money into the account, or they broker will close the account.

##### Example
- At time $T = 0$, stock price is $\$100$
	 - Purchases $100$ shares  
	- Initial position = $\$100 × 100 = \$10,000$  
		- Borrowed: $\$4,000$
		- Equity (Investor’s contribution with own money): $\$6,000$
	- Initial Margin = $\$6,000/10,000 = 60\%$  
- At time $T = 1$, stock price drops to $\$70$  
	- New position = $\$70$ $×$ $100 = \$7, 000$  
		- Borrowed: $\$4,000$  
		- Equity (value belongs to investor): $\$3,000$
	- New Margin = $\$3,000/7,000 = 43\%$  
- Assume broker requires a Maintenance Margin = $30\%$  
- No margin call so far
- Assume broker requires a Maintenance Margin = $30\%$  
- Investor will receive a margin call if price falls below $P = \$57.14$
$$(100 × P − 4, 000)/(100 × P) = 30\%$$
$$P = \$57.14$$
- At this point:  
	- Investors are required to top up the margin account  
	- If the investor fails to act, the broker may sell securities from the  
     account and reduce the loan enough to restore maintenance margin
#### Short selling
- Short selling: profit from a decline in a security’s price.  
- Borrow security from lenders through a broker or dealer  
- Sell the borrowed security  
- At a later date, cover the short position: purchase the equivalent  
  security and pay back the one borrowed  
- Must pay dividends and other benefits that would have accrued to  
  the lender  
- Margin account with the broker is required, so that possible adverse  
  movements (increases) in the price of shorted security are covered  
- Incur lending fee
