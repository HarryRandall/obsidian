#### What is investment?
- The current commitment of money or resources in the expectation of receiving future benefits
- An investments involves:
	- Foregoing consumption of wealth today and investing it with the hope of generating further funds for future consumption;
	- Placing this wealth in **real assets** or **financial assets** that are expected to earn returns in the future.
	- You are giving up your consumption today in order to increase your future consumption, shifting todays consumption into the future.
	- Assuming a certain level of risk, or probability that the investment will yield a lower than expected return.
	- The opposite of investments is consumption, and the economy follows these two main categories.

     securities but take no responsibility on any unsold shares  
- IPO underpricing  
	- The offering price is commonly underpriced compared to the first  
     day trading price

#### Trade securities
- Once issued, securities are bought and sold in secondary markets  
	- **Direct search markets**  
		- Buyers and sellers have to find each other  
		- Searching cost

		- Bid-ask spread
			- Bid is what the dealer wants to pay for the item
			- Ask price is what they sell it for
			- They buy a car for 15k, sell it for 25k.
		- **Bid price** is the price at which the buyer is willing to **buy** a security
		- **Ask price** is the price at which the seller is willing to **sell** a security
		- **Bid-ask** spread is the **difference** between the bid and ask prices
		- Bid should be ≤ Ask, otherwise dealer loses $ on trade.
	- **Auction markets**  
		 - Traders converge to trade in one place (physically or electronically)  
		- Most integrated  
- **Exchanges**
	- Physical place, buyer and seller go there together, more centralised.
- **Over-the-counter** markets (OTC)
	- Less direct, need to contact each other.

- Investors execute trade through two types of orders  
	- **Market order**: a buy or sell order that is to be executed immediately  
     at current market price (i.e., buy at the best ask price and sell at  
     the best bid price)
	- **Price-contingent order** (limit order): a buy or sell order only to be  
     executed at a specified price.
	- **Limit order book**: A collection of limit orders waiting to be executed

###### Example Limit Order Book
Limit Order Book for ANZ Group on ASX Stock Exchange
![[Pasted image 20250726142915.png]]
**Buyers**:
- The 'Buyers' side or Bid Price of the table illustrates the price that those people want to buy an issue of stock for.
- Buyer 1 wants to buy 1,000 issues of the share at the bid price of $24.61 per share.
- Buyer 1 also wants to buy another 1,000 issues of shares at $24.56 per share.
- The $\$24.620$ value of the company, is simply the last recorded sales of stock, so if there is a market order for $1,000$ shares, the stock price will drop down to $\$24.61$. If you ask to buy $20,000$ shares, you will push down the market shares to $\$24.45$.
**Sellers**:
- The 'Buyers' side or Ask Price of the table illustrates the price that those people want to sell an issue of stock for.
- 

**Market Order**: You tell the broker you want to immediately sell your shares for the highest bid price available on the market. 

**E.G.,** You issue a market order to buy 3,000 shares, the broker will look at the Limit Order Book and will sell complete the following orders:

**Buying Shares** (4000 shares):
1. $2,539$ shares to Seller 3 at $\$24.67$ per share for a total of $2,539 \times \$24.67 = \$62,687.91$. 
   ($1,461$ shares left to buy)
2. $1,405$ shares to Buyer 2 at \$$24.68$ per share for a total of $1,405 \times \$24.68 = \$34,675.4$.
   ($56$ shares left to buy)
3. $56$ shares to Buyer 2 at $\$24.69$ per share for a total of $56 \times \$24.69 = \$1,382.64$.
   ($0$ shares left to buy)

##### Trading Costs
- Explicit costs: brokerage commissions, security lending fee
- Implicit costs: bid-ask spread
- Historically, the average round-trip trading costs in stocks is around 0.5%, but it's significantly reduced in recent years.

#### Buying on margin
- Borrowing money to buy securities
- Investors may want to invest an amount greater than own money
- Contribute part of the purchase price with own money
- Borrow the reminder from a broker (margin loans)
- Must pay interest on the loan
- Securities purchased with margin are kept with broker as collateral
- Greater upside potential but also expose to greater downside risk
- "Leverage trading" - magnifies the risk

##### Margin Terms
- **Initial Margin** is the fraction of purchase price contributed by investor when the margin trade is imitated. Usually at least 50%. E.G., you have $100,000 in cash, you can only borrow $50,000.
- **Maintenance margin** is the minimum value that must be kept in account, it depends on brokers but usually lower than initial margin. E.G., you now have $150,000 in your account, so if the account balance drops to $60,000, you will get margin called.
- Investor will receive a **margin call** if the value of the securities falls below maintenance margin. You can either put more money into the account, or they broker will close the account.

##### Example
- At time $T = 0$, stock price is $\$100$
	 - Purchases $100$ shares  
	- Initial position = $\$100 × 100 = \$10,000$  
		- Borrowed: $\$4,000$
		- Equity (Investor’s contribution with own money): $\$6,000$
	- Initial Margin = $\$6,000/10,000 = 60\%$  
- At time $T = 1$, stock price drops to $\$70$  
	- New position = $\$70$ $×$ $100 = \$7, 000$  
		- Borrowed: $\$4,000$  
		- Equity (value belongs to investor): $\$3,000$
	- New Margin = $\$3,000/7,000 = 43\%$  
- Assume broker requires a Maintenance Margin = $30\%$  
- No margin call so far
- Assume broker requires a Maintenance Margin = $30\%$  
- Investor will receive a margin call if price falls below $P = \$57.14$
$$(100 × P − 4, 000)/(100 × P) = 30\%$$
$$P = \$57.14$$
- At this point:  
	- Investors are required to top up the margin account  
	- If the investor fails to act, the broker may sell securities from the  
     account and reduce the loan enough to restore maintenance margin
#### Short selling
- Short selling: profit from a decline in a security’s price.  
- Borrow security from lenders through a broker or dealer  
- Sell the borrowed security  
- At a later date, cover the short position: purchase the equivalent  
  security and pay back the one borrowed  
- Must pay dividends and other benefits that would have accrued to  
  the lender  
- Margin account with the broker is required, so that possible adverse  
  movements (increases) in the price of shorted security are covered  
- Incur lending fee

#### Regulation of trading
- To ensure trading is equitable, orderly and there is full disclosure  
	- Government agencies  
	- In Australia, ASIC ensures the ASX fulfils the requirements set out  
     under the Corporations Act  
- In the US, the SEC along with other agencies administer legislation  
  including the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act,  
  Dodd-Frank Act  
- Industry bodies: this includes securities exchanges together with  
  professional bodies such as the CFA Institute

### Tutorial Questions

Tutors Name: Kevin Zhou
Tutors Email: u7493101@anu.edu.au
##### Question 1: 
How does buying on margin magnify both the upside potential and the downside risk of an investment position?

**Answer**: When using a margin, you are in essence borrowing money from the broker to increase this position. With this increased position, you can make a higher return therefore increasing the potential upside, but you also have more risk as if the investment drops below a certain level, the broker will sell his portion of your position to protect from the risk.

##### Question 2: 
Are the following statements true or false? If false, correct them
**a)** An investor who wishes to sell shares immediately should ask his or her broker to enter a limit order.
**Answer**: This is incorrect. If an investor wants to sell their share immediately, they should use a market order to fill the position, as this will immediately close the position.

**b)** The ask price is less than the bid price
**Answer**: The **ask price** is the price that a seller is willing to sell their stocks for. The **bid price** is the price that a buyer is willing to pay to buy a stock. If $ask < bid$, that wouldn't make sense as the buyers would be buying at a loss and the sellers would be selling at a loss.

**c)** An issue of additional shares of stock to the public by Microsoft would be called an IPO
**Answer**: This is incorrect, as Microsoft is already a public company and has had their Initial Public Offering.

##### Question 3: 
An investor opens a brokerage account and purchases $300$ shares of company A at $\$40$ per share. The investor borrows $\$4,000$ from the broker to help pay for the purchase.

Total long position: $300 \times \$40 = \$12,000$ 
Equity: $\$8,000$
Margin: $\$4,000$
Margin %: $\frac{\$8,000}{\$12,000} = 66.66\%$ 

**(a)** What is the margin in the investor’s account when first purchases the stock?
$\$4,000$ 

**(b)** If the share price falls to $30 per share by the end of the year, what is the remaining margin
in the account?
New long position: $300 \times \$30 = \$9,000$
Margin: $\$4,000$
Equity: $\$5,000$
Margin %: $\frac{\$5,000}{\$9,000} = 55.55\%$ 

**(c)** If the maintenance margin requirement is 30%, will the investor receive a margin call?
No, as $55.55\% > 30\%$ 
(d) What is the rate of return on this investment?
ROI = Final Equity - Initial Equity / Initial Equity
$\frac{5000-8000}{8000} = -37.5\%$

##### Question 4: 
In practice, borrowing margin loans from broker will incur interest. Assume the interest rate on the loan in Question 3 is 8% p.a., annually compounded, please re-compute Question 3.

**(a)** What is the margin in the investor’s account when first purchases the stock?
$\$4,000$ 

**(b)** If the share price falls to $30 per share by the end of the year, what is the remaining margin
in the account?
New long position: $300 \times \$30 = \$9,000 - 320 = \$9,000$
Margin: $\$4,000$ 
Equity: $\$4,680$
Margin %: $\frac{\$4,680}{\$9,000} = 52\%$ 

**(c)** If the maintenance margin requirement is 30%, will the investor receive a margin call?
No, as $52\% > 30\%$ 
(d) What is the rate of return on this investment?
ROI = Final Equity - Initial Equity / Initial Equity
$\frac{4680-8000}{8000} = -41.5\%$

##### Question 5: 
You believe that the market is going to fall shortly, and you want to sell you inventory in stock A as soon as possible. How should you submit your sell order? What is the total revenue from the sale? What is the effective sell price?

3000 stocks of Share A

Sell 1000 @ 24.88 for $24,880
Sell 1600 @ 24.75 for $39,600
Sell 400 @ 24.63 for $9,852
Total = $74,332

Effective sell price = $\frac{74332}{3000} = \$24.78$ 

You are only willing to accept a sell price that is no less than $26.00. How should you
submit your sell order? Where will your order appear in the limit order book?

You will ask for $26.00 for 3000 shares, which will put you at the third position on the order book.
