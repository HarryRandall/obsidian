### Tutorial 9 Questions  

---

### Question 1  
Assume a one-year government coupon bond was just issued by a sovereign country.  
Face value: $F = \$100$  
Coupon rate: $c = 5\%$, paid annually  
One-year risk-free rate: $r_f = 2\%$  

1. Assume this sovereign country is risk-free. Compute the bond price and yield today.  

Discount it back

2. Assume today is in year 2012, and the bond issuer is the Greece government.  
   The credit rating of the Greek government bond was downgraded to “junk” bond.  
   The estimated default probability in one year is $\pi = 30\%$.  
   If default, the recovery ratio is $\ell = 40\%$.  
   The expected bond market return is $E(r_M) = 3\%$.  
   The beta of this bond is $\beta = 0.2$.  

Expected cash flow
- Use CAPM
- 

Recompute the price and yield of this bond.  
In the above two cases, indicate whether the bond is traded at **discount**, **par**, or **premium**.

### Question 2  
In 2016, a 2-year zero coupon bond was issued by LVMH Louis Vuitton with a yield of $-0.25\%$.  
Assume the face value is $F = \$100$.  
Compute the price of this bond on the issuance date.  
Determine whether the bond is traded at **discount**, **par**, or **premium**.
**Premium, as yield is negative.**

### Question 3  
You are considering a 3-year government coupon bond.  
Face value: $F = \$100$  
Coupon rate: $2\%$, paid annually.  
It has been 3 months since the bond issuance.  
You purchased the bond today, and the total purchase price was \$105.35.  
What was the quoted (clean) price of this bond today?

Clean price (104.85)

### Question 4  
One common government support for clean energy companies is enhancing their credit quality.  

Assume a solar energy company plans to issue **10,000** one-year coupon bonds.  
Each bond has:  
- Face value: \$100  
- Annual coupon rate: 5%  
- Risk-free rate: 2%  
- Market expected return: 10%  
- Beta: 0.8  
- Default probability: 20%  
- Recovery rate: 40%  

Before the bond issuance, the government provides an additional **credit guarantee** ensuring a recovery of 80% in the event of default.  
As a result, the credit rating agency raises the rating from **BB to BBB**.  

Compute the **total funds** the company can raise from the bond issuance:  
- (a) Without government support  

Find discount rate with CAPM, 8.4%
We use the same formula as before 
100 * 1.05 * 0.8 + 100 * 1.05 * 0.2 * 0.4 / 1 + 0.0084
Multiply by 10,000 = 852,400

- (b) With government support  

100 * 1.05 * 0.8 + 100 * 1.05 * 0.2 * 0.8 / 1 + 0.0084

Briefly discuss the **benefits** of the government support to this company.
