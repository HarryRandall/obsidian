#### Lecture 1
**Strategic Management - what's involved?**
- Contemporary strategic management views performance as influenced first by an organisation’s characteristics and then by its environment. It involves aligning the organisation’s strengths and weaknesses with external opportunities and threats. This ongoing process includes analysis, synthesis, action, and evaluation.

**Implementation (Stages 4-5)**:
1. Developing a strategic vision, mission, and core values
2. Setting objectives
3. Crafting a strategy to achieve the objectives and company vision
4. Executing the strategy
5. Monitoring developments, evaluating performance, and initiating corrective adjustments
The process involves continuous **understanding and monitoring of the strategic environment** and requires **revision based on actual performance, changing conditions, new opportunities, and new ideas**.

- A vision is meant to focus attention on an alternative future for the organisation, to describe its aspiration
- Without an outcome-oriented view of an organisation's future, actions and decisions can become undirected
- The vision provides a 'destination' before the start of a 'jounrey'
- The vision helps managers identify the 'right things' that need doing
- The vision also describes the values that guide the actions to give substances to the vision.
