- Make it easy to read through, structure isn't that important. 

#### From analysing to strategising 
- You have to explore the internal and external company environment which lets you form a strategic vision of where the company needs to go. This then leads to an identification of strategic options for the company which is then selected and converted into the company model.
- Strategy is normally developed through a combination of design and emergence.
- At the design level, strategy is developed in a board meeting b the top management team as part of a strategic planning process.
- At the **emergent** level, strategy is continuously created by the decisions made by every member of the organisation - especially by middle management. 
- Combining emergent and design strategy maximises the responsiveness and adaptability of the strategic management process.

**External analysis - why?**
- Contemporary strategic management considers that performance is affected by the characteristics of the organisation and its environment, in that order.
	- What an organisation can do (strengths and weaknesses)
	- What is might do (opportunities and threats)

**The key strategic imperative**
1. What is our aspiration? (purpose and intent)
2. Where will we play and with what focus? (geography, products, segments, arenas)
3. How will we win? (Where do we have an advantage? How d we translate that into success?)
4. What capabilities must we have? (What must we be good at to win?)
	1. VIRO framework
5. Management systems? (How do we operate to win most efficiently and effectively?)

Ecosystems - what's needed to succeed?
- Reassess customer need
	- Re-examine and use new frames of thinking to try and understand what the chosen customer segments really need?
- Make yourself indispensable
	- Become essential to the integrated solution and help shape the response to customer demand. Determine where you will position yourself in the integrated ecosystem.
- Question your value proposition
	- Decide whether you are going to be a platform; a platform across platforms; or a developer of apps and services on other people's platforms, etc.
- Prepare for the new normal
	- High performers connect to a wider ecosystem by channelling their capabilities in broader 'market actives'. Even as industries and technologies change, these actives are likely to remain relevant.

**Develop four viable scenarios**
- Optimistic
- Likely
- Pessimistic
- Divergent (disruptive business model)
