#### Week 1
- Was a very good introduction to the course, the convenor is very interactive and is doing what's in the best interest of the students.
- Was able to find a group of 5 people, they seem nice.
- Currently, I don't know that much about management, but the company I work at 'Sprintlaw' has guided me in the right direction. It's in a disruptive market and seems to follow lots of the strategies mentioned in the lecture.
- I'm hoping to go into software development but also start my own business someday so this course has real life and practicle experience for me.
- I'm doing this course as part of my finance/capital markets major
- After the lecture, I've decided to write a Journal entry as recommended by the convenor to track my progress of the course. I will aim to complete these entries once a week after the lecture.
- I'm sitting at a cafe reflecting on the course.
