## Examples

> [!example] Negative Oil Futures Price (2020)
> What happens if you leave your contract until maturity.
> During Covid, there was an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, meaning there was an oversupply.
> - The whole industry was running out of storage space to store their crude oil.
> - They bought so much oil because it was so cheap they didn't have room
> - Because of Covid, people can't use the oil.
> - As the delivery date for the crude oil grew near, the long position (they agreed to buy the crude oil), they realised they won't have any space to store the oil.
> - They start to sell their oil or try to sell out their position.
> - This caused the price to crash to -$35 for crude oil.
> - The long position basically says I don't want the crude oil to the short position as they can't find anywhere to store it.

> [!example] Hedging Principles
> Basic principles of hedging
> - Hold (or expected to hold) a position in an asset.
> - Don't want to be exposed to movements in asset price
> - Hedge to eliminate (or reduce) the exposure in asset price
> - Hedge to eliminate (or reduce) the exposure to price movements
> - Enter a derivatives position that provides a payoff which offsets the price movements in the exposed underlying asset.
> 
> **Strategy**
> - Identify the risk/exposure in the asset
> - Enter a derivatives position that makes money when this unfavourable scenario occurs

> [!example] Construction Company Hedging Example
> - You are a manager of a construction company, you construct roads and highways
> - You just signed a contract to construct a road in Sydney
>   - Assume we are at the beginning of 2019 now.
>   - The road was due to be completed in December 2019.
>   - Towards the end of the construction process, you need to purchase about 500 tonnes of bitumen to complete the road construction.
>   - The current (spot) price of bitumen is $3,000 per ton, but you have no idea what the price will be in late 2019.
>   - You learned that the ASX offers futures contracts on bitumen
>   - This is a Long contract, as you are mitigating your risk.
