## Overview

Efficient market hypothesis (EMH) covering random walk, three forms of EMH, empirical tests, what makes markets efficient, and behavioral finance including information processing errors, behavioral biases, and limits of arbitrage.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Random Walk

- Which of the following reflects a better functioning stock market?
	- A market where the stock prices are perfectly predictable
	- A market where the stock prices move randomly ✓

**Random walk:**
- The changes in stock price are random and cannot be predicted
- Any predictable changes will be exploited immediately
- Reflected into the current stock price

### 2. Efficient Market Hypothesis

**Efficient market hypothesis (EMH)**
> A financial market is (informationally) efficient when market prices reflect all available information about security value

- Security prices should fully reflect all available information
- New information should be incorporated into security prices in an instantaneous and unbiased manner

- About "**efficient**"
	- Risk-return efficient: best $E(r)$ for a given risk (efficient frontier)
	- Informationally efficient: current price is right

- Security prices should fully reflect all available information
- Three forms of efficient market hypothesis (EMH), Fama 1970

	- Weak form: prices reflect past price information (e.g., technical analysis does not generate abnormal return)
	- Semi-strong form: prices reflect all publicly available information (e.g., fundamental analysis does not generate abnormal return)
	- Strong form: prices reflect all publicly and privately available information, including past and present (e.g., insider trading does not generate abnormal return)

- New information should be incorporated into security prices in an instantaneous and unbiased manner

**Example:**
> Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was approved by FDA on August 10, 2021. How should the share price of Pfizer react to this news?

  - Increase immediately to a new equilibrium level (efficient market reaction)
  - Increase gradually to the new equilibrium (under-reaction)
  - First over-shoot and then settle back to new equilibrium level (over-reaction)

![[Pasted image 20250916113003.png]]

- In an efficient market:
	- Security prices should fully reflect all available information
	- Any new information should be incorporated into security prices instantaneously in an unbiased way
	- Information drives price changes
	- New information is unpredictable, so changes in prices are also unpredictable
	- Therefore, stock price changes should follow a random walk

- Investing in an efficient market:
  - Does not mean that you cannot make money
  - Only earn a risk premium that is compensation for the market risks
  - No bias in prices that can be exploited to earn abnormal returns

### 3. Empirical Tests of EMH

#### 3.1. Weak Form EMH

(1) Weak form EMH: prices reflect past information

> Empirical evidence

- ✓ Technical analysis trading are not consistently profitable
- ✓ Serial correlations in daily stock returns are close to zero
- ✗ Momentum:
  - Past winners (losers) continue to win (lose) in near future
  - Over long-term, momentum reversal is an indication of over-reaction

#### 3.2. Semi-Strong Form EMH

(2) Semi-strong form EMH: prices reflect all publicly available information, including past and present

**Empirical evidence**

- Asset pricing anomalies (size, value, etc.)
- Publicly available risk factors are able to explain most stock returns (e.g. Fama-French 3-factor model)
- Prices react to news quickly and unbiased (event studies)

Examples: earnings announcements, stock splits, mergers and acquisitions, FDA approval of vaccines, etc.

- Issues with anomalies and semi-strong EMH

1. Anomalies like size, value, etc. arise because
   - Evidence against market efficiency, or
   - Just risk-factors and market is efficient

2. Joint-hypothesis issue of testing
   - A significant alpha means market is inefficient, or
   - Maybe the model used is imperfect

- Event study:
  - Investigate the impact of a certain event on stock prices (returns)
  - Based on a benchmark (asset pricing models)

**Steps:**
1. Regression to estimate $\beta$ of a stock using returns before the event
2. Predict returns around event
3. Abnormal return = observed return - model predicted return
4. Cumulate abnormal returns through event window
5. Repeat over all stocks with the same event
6. Analyze CAR pattern

#### 3.3. Strong Form EMH

(3) Strong form EMH: prices reflect all publicly and privately available information, including past and present

**Empirical evidence**

- Whether insiders profit from inside information?
- Insider trading is heavily regulated
- Australian laws prohibit trading on non-public, material information

### 4. What Makes Market Efficient?

- Public information:
	- Trade on it to correct mispricing

- Private information:
	- Analyst research
	- Example: satellites predicting oil price changes

- Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox:
	- If market is strong form efficient, no incentive to gather info
	- If no one gathers info, how is it reflected in prices?
	- Market unlikely to be strong-form efficient

### 5. Behavioural Finance

- Asset pricing anomalies:
  - Some portfolios mispriced relative to models
  - Mispricing persists

- Explanations:
  - Missing systematic risks
  - Current models insufficient
  - Investors may not be rational

- Key ideas:
  - Information processing errors and biases
  - Behavioral biases
  - Limits of arbitrage

### 6. Information Processing Errors and Biases

- Investors don't always process information correctly
- Examples:
	- Extrapolation and pattern recognition
	- Limited attention
	- Overreaction
	- Underreaction
	- Overconfidence
	- Conservatism

1. Extrapolation and pattern recognition
	- Sample size neglect
	- Generalising small samples

2. Limited attention
	- Decisions based on headlines or heuristics
	- Social media exacerbates this

3. Over-reaction / Under-reaction

![[Pasted image 20250916122522.png]]

4. Overconfidence
   - Overestimate ability and forecast precision
   - Men trade more actively, perform worse (Barber & Odean 2001)

5. Conservatism
   - Slow to update beliefs with new info

### 7. Behavioral Biases

- Even with perfect information processing, investors may act irrationally

**Types:**
- Prospect theory (loss-aversion)
- Regret avoidance
- Mental accounting
- Lottery-like behaviour

1. Prospect theory (loss aversion)
   - Gains vs losses valued differently
   - Willingness to take more risk to avoid loss
   - Example: not selling losing stocks

2. Regret avoidance
   - Fear of regret drives poor decisions

3. Mental accounting
   - Assigning subjective values to money for different purposes
   - Leads to inconsistent decisions

4. Lottery-like behaviour
   - Some stocks resemble lottery tickets
   - Risk-seeking behaviour despite negative expected return

### 8. Limits of Arbitrage

- Arbitrage strategies restricted in practice
- Limits:
  - Market frictions (transaction costs, fees, illiquidity)
  - Model risk
  - Unfavourable price movements, margin calls
  - Irrational crowds (e.g., GME short squeeze)
  - Sudden government intervention

- Remarks:
  - Only major behavioural stories covered
  - Biases often appear together
  - Important in finance and investments
  - Debate continues: anomalies due to risk factors or behavioural biases
  - Growing research in behavioural finance and neuroscience

## Notes



---

## Examples

> [!example] Efficient Market Reaction
> When Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine was approved, an efficient market would incorporate this news immediately, causing the price to jump to a new equilibrium level without over- or under-reaction.

> [!example] Event Study
> Event studies analyze abnormal returns around corporate events (earnings announcements, M&A) to test whether markets efficiently incorporate public information.
