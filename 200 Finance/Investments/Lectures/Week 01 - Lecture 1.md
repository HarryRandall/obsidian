## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Investment?

- The current commitment of money or resources in the expectation of receiving future benefits
- An investment involves:
  - Foregoing consumption of wealth today and investing it with the hope of generating further funds for future consumption
  - Placing this wealth in **real assets** or **financial assets** that are expected to earn returns in the future
  - Giving up consumption today in order to increase future consumption, shifting today's consumption into the future
  - Assuming a certain level of risk, i.e., a probability that the investment will yield a lower-than-expected return
- The opposite of investment is consumption, and the economy broadly follows these two main categories

### 2. Real Assets

- Used to produce goods and services
- Examples:
  - Land
  - Buildings
  - Machines
  - Software (not tangible, but still a real asset)
  - Physical commodities

### 3. Financial Assets

- A contractual claim on the income generated by the **real assets**
- Do not directly contribute to the productive capacity of the economy
- Traded in financial markets
- Allow investment risk to be shared
- Allow a separation of ownership and control
  - Even if you own the building, you don't manage the building
- Examples:
  - Stocks
  - Bonds (IOUs)
  - Derivatives

### 4. Portfolios

- When constructing an investment portfolio, investors make two main decisions:
  - **Asset allocation**: choose between broad asset classes:
    - Equities
    - Fixed income
    - Land
    - etc.
  - **Security selection**: within the asset class, which security to invest in (e.g., should I buy AAPL or MSFT?)
- Once initially formed, the portfolio is then periodically rebalanced:
  - Sell existing investments and replace with new ones
  - Reinvest the income from investments:
    - Dividends
    - Interest
  - Add funds to purchase additional securities

### 5. Financial Markets and Instruments

**Money markets:**
- Trade short-term, liquid, low-risk debt securities
- Instruments:
  - Treasury bills
  - Certificates of deposit
  - Commercial paper
  - Repurchase agreements

**Capital markets:**
- Investors need to assume more risk
- Trade medium–long-term and riskier securities
- Instruments:
  - Long-term bonds
  - Equity
  - Derivatives
- Equity market
- Bond market
- Derivatives market

**Foreign exchange market**

**Bond market:**
- Treasury notes and bonds
  - Government-backed; low default risk
  - Higher government borrowing can be associated with higher yields (greater perceived risk)
- Corporate bonds
  - More likely to default compared to government
- Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (MBS, ABS)
  - Underlying loans are packaged and sold as securities

**Equity market:**
- Common shares
  - Stocks of individual companies
- Preferred shares
  - More rights than common shares

**Derivatives market:**
- Forwards and futures
- Options
- Swaps
- Credit default swaps (CDS)

### 6. Participants in the Financial Markets

- **Firms**
  - Net demanders of capital
  - Raise capital to build factories and buy equipment
  - Sell products/services to households
- **Households** (individual/retail investors)
  - Typically net suppliers of capital
  - Purchase securities issued by firms
- **Governments**
  - Function as borrowers or lenders
  - Mostly borrowers
- **Financial intermediaries**
  - Link suppliers of capital and demanders of capital
  - Produce and transmit information
  - Facilitate transactions

    - Benefits of diversification and transaction-cost savings
    - Professional management
  - **Open-end**: investors can exit by selling shares back to the fund
  - **Closed-end**: investors can only exit by selling shares to each other
- **Mutual funds**
  - Common name for open-end funds, defined by investment policy

### 8. Issue Securities

- When firms need to raise capital, they can do so by issuing securities
- New securities are issued to raise funds in the **primary markets** (i.e., investors face companies directly):
  - **Public offering**
    - Initial public offering (IPO)
      - Extensive requirements and regulation
    - Seasoned equity offering (SEO)
  - **Private placement**: lower disclosure requirements but smaller size
- Once issued, securities are bought and sold in **secondary markets** (i.e., investors trade with other investors):
  - Direct search markets
  - Brokered markets
  - Dealer markets
  - Auction markets

**Initial public offering (IPO):**
- A private firm raises capital from the general public
- First issue of shares to the public = IPO
- IPOs (stocks and bonds) are typically marketed by underwriters:
  - **Firm commitment:** underwriter(s) purchase the entire issue at a certain price and resell to the public
  - **Best efforts:** underwriter(s) commit in good faith to market the securities but take no responsibility for any unsold shares
- **IPO underpricing**
  - The offering price is commonly underpriced compared to the first-day trading price
  - Example: average first-day return on Australian IPOs is about $20\%$
  - Widely studied but still an ongoing research topic

### 9. Trade Securities

- Once issued, securities are bought and sold in **secondary markets**:
  - **Direct search markets**
    - Buyers and sellers must find each other
    - Search costs
    - Think of direct outreach (e.g., a classifieds marketplace)
  - **Brokered markets**
    - Brokers search out buyers and sellers
    - Brokerage fee
  - **Dealer markets**
    - Dealers hold inventories of assets from which they buy and sell
    - **Bid–ask spread**
      - **Bid price**: the price at which a buyer is willing to **buy** a security
      - **Ask price**: the price at which a seller is willing to **sell** a security
      - **Bid–ask spread**: the **difference** between the bid and ask prices
      - Bid should be $\leq$ Ask; otherwise the dealer would lose money
  - **Auction markets**
    - Traders converge to trade in one place (physically or electronically)
    - Most integrated
- **Exchanges**
  - Centralised venues where buyers and sellers meet
- **Over-the-counter (OTC) markets**
  - Decentralised; participants trade by contacting one another

- Investors execute trades through two types of orders:
  - **Market order**: a buy or sell order executed immediately at the current market price (i.e., buy at the best ask price and sell at the best bid price)
  - **Price-contingent order (limit order)**: a buy or sell order executed only at a specified price
  - **Limit order book**: a collection of limit orders waiting to be executed

**Example Limit Order Book:**

Limit Order Book for ANZ Group on ASX Stock Exchange

![[Pasted image 20250726142915.png]]

**Buyers:**
- The "Buyers" side (Bid) lists the prices at which participants want to buy shares
- Buyer 1 wants to buy $1{,}000$ shares at a bid price of $\$24.61$ per share
- Buyer 1 also wants to buy another $1{,}000$ shares at $\$24.56$ per share
- The $\$24.620$ shown is the last recorded sale price. If there is a market order for $1{,}000$ shares to **sell**, the transaction would likely execute at $\$24.61$. A larger sell order (e.g., $20{,}000$ shares) could push the execution down the bid stack, potentially as low as $\$24.45$

**Sellers:**
- The "Sellers" side (Ask) lists the prices at which participants want to sell shares

**Market Order**: You tell the broker you want to immediately buy or sell at the best available price

**E.g.,** You issue a market order to **buy $4{,}000$ shares**. The broker will execute the following orders based on the limit order book:

**Buying Shares** ($4{,}000$ shares):
1. Buy $2{,}539$ shares from Seller 3 at $\$24.67$ per share for a total of $2{,}539 \times \$24.67 = \$62{,}687.91$
   ($1{,}461$ shares left to buy)
2. Buy $1{,}405$ shares from Seller 2 at $\$24.68$ per share for a total of $1{,}405 \times \$24.68 = \$34{,}675.40$
   ($56$ shares left to buy)
3. Buy $56$ shares from Seller 2 at $\$24.69$ per share for a total of $56 \times \$24.69 = \$1{,}382.64$
   ($0$ shares left to buy)

### 10. Trading Costs

- **Explicit costs**: brokerage commissions, security-lending fees
- **Implicit costs**: bid–ask spread
- Historically, the average round-trip trading cost in stocks is around $0.5\%$, but it has been significantly reduced in recent years

### 11. Buying on Margin

- Borrowing money to buy securities
- Investors may want to invest an amount greater than their own money
- Contribute part of the purchase price with own funds
- Borrow the remainder from a broker (margin loans)
- Must pay interest on the loan
- Securities purchased with margin are kept with the broker as collateral
- Greater upside potential but also greater downside risk
- "Leveraged trading" magnifies risk

**Margin Terms:**
- **Initial margin**: the fraction of the purchase price contributed by the investor when the margin trade is initiated; usually at least $50\%$
  - E.g., you have $\$100{,}000$ in cash; you can borrow up to $\$100{,}000$ total position with at least $50\%$ equity
- **Maintenance margin**: the minimum equity that must be kept in the account; depends on brokers but is usually lower than the initial margin
  - E.g., if your account value drops toward the maintenance threshold, you may receive a margin call
- Investor will receive a **margin call** if the equity falls below the maintenance margin. You can either deposit more money or the broker may liquidate positions

**Example:**
- At time $T=0$, stock price is $\$100$
  - Purchase $100$ shares
  - Initial position $= \$100 \times 100 = \$10{,}000$
    - Borrowed: $\$4{,}000$
    - Equity (investor's own funds): $\$6{,}000$
  - Initial margin $= \$6{,}000 / \$10{,}000 = 60\%$
- At time $T=1$, stock price drops to $\$70$
  - New position $= \$70 \times 100 = \$7{,}000$
    - Borrowed: $\$4{,}000$
    - Equity (value belonging to investor): $\$3{,}000$
  - New margin $= \$3{,}000 / \$7{,}000 = 43\%$
- Assume broker requires a maintenance margin of $30\%$
  - No margin call so far
- Investor will receive a margin call if price falls below $P=\$57.14$:
  $$
  \frac{100 \times P - 4{,}000}{100 \times P} = 30\%
  $$
  $$
  P = \$57.14
  $$
- At this point:
  - Investors are required to top up the margin account
  - If the investor fails to act, the broker may sell securities from the account and reduce the loan enough to restore the maintenance margin

### 12. Short Selling

- Short selling: profit from a decline in a security's price
- Borrow the security from a lender via a broker or dealer
- Sell the borrowed security
- Later, **cover** the short position: purchase the equivalent security and return it to the lender
- Must pay dividends and other benefits that would have accrued to the lender
- A margin account with the broker is required to cover adverse price movements (price increases)
- Incur lending fees

### 13. Regulation of Trading

- To ensure trading is equitable, orderly, and fully disclosed:
  - **Government agencies**
    - In Australia, ASIC ensures the ASX fulfils requirements under the Corporations Act
    - In the US, the SEC and other agencies administer legislation including the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, and the Dodd–Frank Act
  - **Industry bodies**
    - Securities exchanges and professional bodies such as the CFA Institute

## Examples

> [!example] Real vs Financial Assets
> Real assets (land, buildings, machines) produce goods/services, while financial assets (stocks, bonds) are contractual claims on income from real assets.

> [!example] IPO Underpricing
> Average first-day return on Australian IPOs is about 20%, meaning offering prices are commonly underpriced compared to first-day trading prices.

> [!example] Limit Order Book
> Collection of limit orders waiting to be executed, showing bid and ask prices at different price levels.

> [!example] Buying on Margin
> Borrowing money to buy securities, magnifying both upside potential and downside risk. Margin call occurs if equity falls below maintenance margin.

> [!example] Short Selling
> Borrowing and selling securities to profit from price declines, requiring margin account and payment of dividends to lender.
