## Key Concepts

### 1. The Information Systems Strategy (What makes a good one)

- **Alignment** - clearly aligns with business strategy, key performance indicators and technology governance principles
- **Realistic** - provides a realistic assessment of current capabilities and the ability of the organisation to absorb new technologies
- **Clarity** - clearly explains the strategy in technical and non-technical terms
- **Organisational change** - describes how organisational change will be managed by senior management and programs/projects
- **Time based** - provides description of initiatives on a timeline throughout the planning horizon. Recognises that there are dependencies within the plan
- **Financially sound** - provides realistic capital and operating budget estimates. Demonstrates Business value and ROI
- **Innovation** - incorporates appropriate innovation that clearly drives business transformation
- **Buy In** - likely to receive executive and senior management support in an environment where everyone is competing for capital

### 2. Social Media Strategy

- Helps us to establish our personal brands as we post to friends, family, communities and, potentially, complete strangers
- Employers use Social media to evaluate potential candidates and it should be assumed that the data you post on any site is going to be available forever

### 3. Digital Strategy

- Organisations view and develop technology strategies from many different perspectives depending on the need
- To drive value from technology there is often an overarching Information System strategy with linkages to "sub-strategies"
- Note that organisations develop strategies in many ways
- In this course, we'll view Information Systems as an overarching strategy leading into Social Media and Digital Transformation
- In practice, there's significant overlap however, it's useful to examine each individually so we understand the relevant components of each
- This way, when combined, we make sure we haven't missed anything

### 4. The Strategy Diamond

1. **Arenas** - where will we be active (e.g., online platforms, mobile apps)
2. **Vehicles** - How will we get there? (e.g., build in-house, partner with tech firms)
3. **Differentiators** - How will we win (e.g., superior UX, personalised services)
4. **Staging** - What will be our speed and sequence of moves?
5. **Economic Logic** - how will we make money or create value (e.g., reduce costs through automation, increase revenue via digital channels)
