## Overview

*Brief summary of today's lecture topics...*

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Utilitarianism

- We do what's best for everyone
- Conflict with egoism (best for individual)
- E.G., CCTV, utilitarianism is used to find criminals, but egoism could say it's unethical as it could be used to find political disobedience

### 2. Egoism

- Good for the consumer, bad for the developer of the music (e.g., Napster)
- Utilitarianism: Kinda a grey area, good for most, bad for some

### 3. Simon's Decision Making Model

1. **Intelligence** - gathering information about the problem
2. **Design** - developing possible solutions
3. **Choice** - selecting the best solution
4. **Implementation** - putting the solution into action
5. **Monitoring** - evaluating the results

### 4. Digital Diamond for Tres Fortunas

**Arenas:**
- Increase social media presence
- Online ordering services
- Digital Loyalty Program

**Vehicles (How we reach the customer):**
- Partner with Uber or Deliveroo etc

**Differentiators:**
- Quality

**Staging:**
- Franchising, test in

**Economic Logic:**
- 

### 5. Data Security Advice for Rafael Castillo (CEO of Tres Fortunas)

- Limiting DB access to internal employees
- Upgrading internal security, regular checks with a third party
- Rich picture to see how the data flows and how it's stored and accessed
- Now we know how it's stored and accessed, we can visualise threats:
  - Limit access to external employees
  - Data encryption
  -

## Examples

> [!example] Utilitarianism vs Egoism
> Utilitarianism focuses on what's best for everyone, while egoism focuses on what's best for the individual. For disruptive technologies like Napster, utilitarianism creates a grey area (good for most consumers, bad for some developers), while egoism clearly benefits consumers but harms developers.

> [!example] Simon's Decision Making Model
> A five-stage model: Intelligence (gathering information), Design (developing solutions), Choice (selecting solution), Implementation (putting into action), Monitoring (evaluating results).

> [!example] Digital Diamond Strategy
> A framework for developing digital strategies with five components: Arenas (where to be active), Vehicles (how to get there), Differentiators (how to win), Staging (speed and sequence), Economic Logic (how to make money or create value).
