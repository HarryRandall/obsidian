## Overview

*Brief summary of today's lecture topics...*

## Key Concepts

### 1. Purpose of a Balanced Scorecard

- Links strategic objectives to performance measures
- Provides a holistic view beyond just financial metrics, including customer, internal processes, and learning & growth
- Helps organisations monitor progress towards strategic goals and improve performance

### 2. Two SDLC Methods (Waterfall & Agile)

- **Waterfall:** A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, etc.) must be completed before the next begins
- **Agile:** An iterative and incremental approach that emphasises flexibility, collaboration, and frequent delivery of working software in cycles
- Differ fundamentally in their structure: Waterfall is rigid and predictive, while Agile is flexible and adaptive

### 3. Challenges in Managing Data

- Ensuring data quality (accuracy, completeness, consistency)
- Handling the ever-increasing volume and variety of data
- Maintaining data security and privacy while complying with regulations

### 4. Benefits of Implementing an ERP Solution

- Integrates processes and data across different business functions into a single system
- Increases operational efficiency through process automation and streamlining
- Provides improved insights and decision-making capabilities with real-time, integrated data

### 5. Challenges of Implementing an ERP Solution

- High initial costs and ongoing maintenance expenses
- Complexity and significant time required for implementation
- Potential for resistance to change among employees and disruption to existing operations

### 6. Technology Adoption Categories

- **Revolutionary's** → Napster
- **Early Adopter** → Netflix
- **Late Majority, Laggards** → Blockbuster
