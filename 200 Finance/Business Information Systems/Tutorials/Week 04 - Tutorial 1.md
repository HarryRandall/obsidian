## Key Concepts

### 1. Three Technology-Focused Strategies

1. **Social Media Strategy**
   - Leveraging social media to grow the brand and business
   - Advantages/purpose: collaboration, customer engagement, fund raising etc.
   - Social Web 2.0: Communicates, content creation, relationships in the virtual context, different devices

2. **Information System Strategy**
   - How an organisation will work with technology during the planning horizon (18 months - 3 years) - relates to EA
   - Consists of Rich pictures, communication plans etc.
   - Align with business strategy, time-based etc

3. **Digital (Business) Strategy**
   - Input (Internal and external factors analysis)
   - Processing (how will these factors influence our business (Arenas, vehicles, differentiation, staging?))
   - Output - Developing the digital transformations strategy, economics, logic

### 2. Purpose of Digital Transformation

- A change in how a firm employs digital technologies, to develop a new digital business model that helps to create and appropriate more value of the firm
- Value creation and capture: increased value from information; multisided business models; coordinated business models in networks; control of digital industry architecture

### 3. Architecture Principles, Vision, and Requirements

1. Will my personal needs change over the next 2-3 years?
   - My new job will require me to gain an understanding of many evolving technologies

2. How do I want my technology to change over this period?
   - I want it to be simplified and amplified in terms of swiftness

3. Should I decide to keep or change the tech that I have?
   - Change, whilst there is a cost to upgrade, Moore's law states that transistors and or technology as a whole will

4. What constraints do I need to live with?
   - Data privacy issues

### 4. Business Architecture

1. What daily processes does the tech support?
2. Who is using the technology?
   - Teammates, myself, boss
3. What is driving the use of this technology?

### 5. Information Systems Architecture

1. What personal information is stored and used by the tech?
   - (Interview participants recordings, company confidential information, etc.)
2. What are my most commonly used applications?
