## Key Concepts

### 1. TOGAF Enterprise Architecture (EA)

- The Enterprise Architecture (EA) provides a detailed description (blueprint) of the physical, information, process, and governance architectures that supports an organisation's use of technology
- TOGAF is a methodology for the development of EA
- The development of an EA is an ongoing process
- It consists of 5 interconnected domains

### 2. The 5 Domains of TOGAF

1. **Architecture principles, vision, and requirements** - The company's belief, value and purpose of developing an EA
2. **Business architecture** - A holistic business view of a company's business, org structure, strategies, and policies etc.
3. **Information system architecture** - A description of a company's information system (data, entities, and systems)
4. **Technology architecture** - Technology functionality, interfaces=APIs, data formats, protocols, hardware interfaces, standards, map to business entities
5. **Architecture realisation** - How will we get to our target architecture
