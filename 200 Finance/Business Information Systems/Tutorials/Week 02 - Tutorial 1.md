### 2. Why Should We Care About System Modelling?

- To describe a system
- To describe the technical details
- To communicate with executive management
- To explain the basis of detailed, technical conversations
  - Even if you're not an IT person, understanding how to use some of these models enables you to have informed conversations with your IT colleagues
- We want to understand how organisations use information systems
- Assess whether an IS is getting the most out of their technology

### 3. How Can You Use a Rich Picture?

- It helps people to visualise and discuss their own role in the organisation
- It can be used to define the aspects of the organisation which are intended to be covered by the information system
- It can be used to show up the worries of individuals, potential conflicts, and political issues
- Lack of space on the paper forces decisions on what is really important

### 4. How to Develop a Rich Picture

- What is the system that you are trying to model
- Who are the actors involved in this narrative?
- What types of technology are they using
- Identify in this order:
  - Actors
  - Systems
- Use icons when using rich pictures
