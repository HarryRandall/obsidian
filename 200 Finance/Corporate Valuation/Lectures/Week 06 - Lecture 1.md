## Overview

Incorporating growth potential covering investment opportunities, organic growth, investment issues, evaluating new investments, acquisitions, and common DCF valuation errors.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Recap

1. A company generates an (uncertain) stream of cash flows from its existing operations. The value of such operations is the NPV of these cash flows.
   - If a company can get more net cash flow out of its existing operations, the company will be worth more
   - Need to account for cash reinvested to maintain operations
   - If the cost of capital falls, the business is also worth more

2. Additional value is created if the company can invest in new projects earning above the cost of capital.
   - 'True' growth stocks have access to such opportunities
   - Investments that earn below cost of capital will destroy value, regardless of what happens to top-line sales growth

### 2. Investment Opportunities: The link to value

- So far, we have focused on modelling, forecasting and valuing the current operations... including reinvestment in those operations
- Most probably your company is forecasted to generate loads of Free Cash Flows that is applied to financial flows, e.g. pay dividends, reduce debt
- This is not how the world works: They will probably spend the cash!
- A key value driver (i.e., source of change in value) is how a company chooses to use the cash flows and assets at its disposal

**Questions to ask:**
- How might the company deploy cash flow?
- Will any investment earn a return exceeding cost of capital?

### 3. Organic Growth

- Term 'organic growth' refers to ability to grow existing operations
- Often associated with fast revenue growth, but this is not enough in its own right to create value
- Return at the margin is what matters most
  - ROI > WACC (the hurdle rate)
  - Growing revenues faster than invested capital => ROIC rises
  - I.E., operating leverage, scalable business
- Companies can grow revenues and possibly EPS (earnings per share) by increasing invested capital (e.g. earnings retention, borrowings), but value only created if marginal ROIC > cost of capital

**Example:**
**Retail Sales (consumer staples) - a pandemic recount:**
- Spending on groceries and toiletries in the week ending Mar. 20 was 80% higher than the same period last year
- For the week ending Mar. 27, the growth has moderated to 46% higher than the same period the prior year; alcohol soared 86% higher

**Does the growth increase Woolworths value?**
- Where to start?
- What framework to use?
- Drivers? Sustainability?
  - Pandemic - we don't know how long it's going to last
- Price vs. value, which perspective?

### 4. Investment Issues

- Investments can be like a double-edged sword
- Prerequisite for growth
- Source of risk
  - Expansion of capacity may dilute returns (spreading of revenues over larger capital base; impact on pricing power)
  - Expansion often occurs at top of cycle
  - Tendency for companies to expand at the same time
  - Short term dilution (funding & depreciation during ramp-up)

### 5. Evaluating New Investments

- Don't take the company's word that an investment is NPV positive. Do your own number crunching if possible
- Three types of investment:
  1. Capacity expansion (view with skepticism)
  2. Creation of new products or markets (more uncertain, judge on merits)
  3. Efficiency enhancing (payoffs usually more reliable)
- Some questions to ask when a company invests:
  - Where is the competitive advantage?
  - Any impact on industry structure?
  - How will other players react?
  - Do I trust management? What is driving their decision?

**Example:**

![[Pasted image 20250929180207.png]]

- Inputs are all given

**Sales:**
- Sales = Product Price * Volume Sold
- Variable costs = volume sold * variable cost
- Fixed costs = 200 (fixed value)
- Depreciation = 100 (fixed value)
- Costs = variable costs + fixed costs + depreciation

**EBIT:**
- EBIT = sales - costs
- Tax on EBIT = EBIT * 25%

**NOPLAT:**
- NOPLAT = EBIT - Tax on EBIT
- NOPLAT margin = NOPLAT / Sales
- New Invested Capital = 1000 (fixed value) - depreciation - Capex & ΔWCap
- RONIC = NOPLAT / New Invested Capital

**Cash Flow:**
- NOPLAT = defined
- Depreciation = defined
- Capex & ΔWCap = -(depreciation)
- **FCF** = sum(NOPLAT + Depreciation + Capex & ΔWCap)

**NPV:**
- WACC = defined (8%)
- Discount factor = 1 / (1+8%)
- Present value = discount factor * present value

### 6. Acquisitions

- Majority of acquisitions (possibly up to two-thirds) destroy or create no value for bidder's shareholders. Potential reasons:
  - Merger benefits paid to target's shareholders / winner's curse
  - Merger costs are often under-estimated
  - Merger activity often occurs at the top of the cycle

### 7. Relevance for Assignments

- Organic growth of existing operations should be incorporated in your model and forecasts
- Analysis of investment, acquisitions and other growth opportunities is optional
- A checklist of possibilities to consider:
  - New projects? Do a NPV
  - Aggressive over-investment (or underinvestment) by company or industry? Analyse a possible scenario (Week 9)
  - M&A activity a real possibility? Create value impact
  - Possible divestments? Do a NPV
- Put yourself in the shoes of executives, consider organic growth, acquisitions and possible investment opportunities

### 8. Common DCF Valuation Errors

1. Failing to subject forecast ROIC to a reality check
2. Understanding capex, so that asset turnover blows out
3. Modelling business portfolios with no provision for losers
4. Poorly specific value
   - Using CV as the accelerator or brake to offset other errors
   - Capitalising unsustainably high NOPLAT in final period
   - Unjustifiable / inadvertent allowance for ongoing value-creation
5. Disconnection between growth rate and WACC

## Notes

## Examples

> [!example] Organic Growth
> Growth in existing operations where return at the margin (RONIC) exceeds WACC creates value, even if revenue growth is fast.

> [!example] Investment Evaluation
> Three types: Capacity expansion (skeptical), New products/markets (uncertain), Efficiency enhancing (reliable payoffs).

> [!example] Acquisitions
> Majority destroy value due to winner's curse, underestimated costs, and timing at cycle peaks.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Organic Growth | Ability to grow existing operations, creating value when RONIC > WACC |
| RONIC | Return on New Invested Capital - return on marginal investments |
| Operating Leverage | Growing revenues faster than invested capital, leading to rising ROIC |
| Winner's Curse | In acquisitions, paying too much for target companies |
| NPV | Net Present Value - present value of investment cash flows |
