## Overview

Introduction to corporate valuation covering fundamental concepts of value, valuation approaches, and ways of thinking about company value.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Value?

- **Rule 1**: Value = net present value of future cash flows
- **Rule 2**: All valuation methods ultimately come back to Rule 1
  - Valuation methods are only valid as they are somehow linked to the net present value of future cash flows

### 2. Valuation Approaches

1. **Multiple-based valuation**: Capitalisation of near-term earnings or cash flow (E.G., PE)
2. **Asset-based valuations**: Adding up individual company assets
3. **Net present value (or discounted cash flow) techniques**

**General comments:**
- Each approach has strengths and weaknesses
- Arguments for a composite of valuation indicators
- Why does the course start with DCF?
  - This is the method that is most closely linked to **Rule 1**

### 3. A Way of Thinking About Company Value

1. A company generates an (**uncertain**) stream of cash flows from its **existing operations**. The value of such operations is the NPV of these cash flows.
   - If a company can get more net cash flow out of its existing operations, the company will be worth more
   - Need to account for cash reinvested to maintain operations
   - If the cost of capital falls, the business is also worth more

2. Additional value is created if the company can invest in new projects earning above the cost of capital.
   - 'True' growth stocks have access to such opportunities
     - Young companies get value from the additional value that **could** be created
     - **Amazon** had negative cash flows, but there is potential additional cash flows. These companies are called 'Growth Stocks'
   - Investments that earn below cost of capital will destroy value, regardless of what happens to top-line sales growth

## Examples

> [!example] Growth Stocks
> Companies like Amazon had negative cash flows but potential for additional cash flows, making them 'Growth Stocks' valued for future opportunities.
