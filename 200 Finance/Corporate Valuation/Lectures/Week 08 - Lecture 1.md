## Overview

Asset-based valuations covering foundations, price/net asset backing, and variations on the asset-based perspective on value.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Foundations

- A company can be viewed as a collection of assets
- Another view on 'value' is to examine what this collection of assets may be worth on the open market (to sell)
- This value may not always equal your NPV estimate - although clearly asset prices and NPV of cash flows should be related (e.g., diversified conglomerates are priced at a discount relative to more "focused" companies if firm characteristics and other factors are controlled)

**Three variations on the asset-based perspective on value:**
1. Price / asset backing
2. SOTP / break-up valuations
3. Takeover valuations

### 2. Price / Net Asset Backing

**Two forms:**
1. Price / Net Book Value of Equity (also called 'Market-to-Book')
2. Price / Net Tangible Assets

- No. of shares: all classes of ordinary shares (some classes of shares might carry less than one or no voting rights)
- NTA preferred when valuing intangible assets is subjective or 'grey' - e.g. 20% of P&G and Unilever's total assets are the value of their intangible assets: brand names
- Conceptually appropriate to dilute for options, etc. Although rarely done in practice, give it some consideration
- Premium over NetBookValue is sometimes attributed to 'franchise value'
- Better when asset backing is meaningful, e.g. REITs, financials

**Formulas:**
- Net Book Value of Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
- Net Tangible Assets = Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Intangible assets

> [!example] Net Tangible Assets
> Total Assets - Total Liabilities - Intangible assets - preferred when intangible assets are subjective.
