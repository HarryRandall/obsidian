## Overview

Sensitivity and scenario analysis covering main purpose, examining model mechanics, developing sensible sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis overview, and implications for assignments.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Main Purpose

- View your valuation as the most likely outcome within a distribution of possibilities (and not as a point estimate)
- Sensitivity and scenario analysis both help gauge that distribution
- Share prices are driven by changes in expectations. Use your company model to focus on:
  - What matters?
    - Identify important potential sources of change
  - How much?
    - Magnitude of impact on value and hence price
  - Any skew?
    - Upside versus downside potential

### 2. Examining Model Mechanics

**Two Perspectives:**
1. Checking internal consistency of the model - Does output change as expected when you plug in different numbers? Direction? Magnitude
   - **Note:** Examine diagnostics like ROIC and ROIC drivers; not just the end valuation
2. Understanding sensitivity to key assumptions - Find out what matters most for both cash flows and your valuation
   - **Ask yourself:** Does it make sense to have such sensitivity in my model? Should I do anything about it?

### 3. Develop Sensible Sensitivity Analysis

**Possible targets for sensitivity analysis:**
1. Revenue Growth - response to change in key drivers
2. Key costs / margins - Response to change in main inputs
3. Investment required - capital spending, working capital, etc
4. Continuing value - assumed value creation beyond forecasts
5. Cost of capital inputs - beta, ERP, perhaps cost of debt
6. Capital structure - impact of deviating from assumed gearing
7. Currency sensitivity - if relevant

**Examining Model Mechanics - Traps to avoid:**
- Sensitivity analysis of an arbitrary selection of variables without considering their correlations - feasibility of your assumptions are overlooked in modelling
- **Example:** Increase EBITDA margin by 5%
  - Where is it from? Higher price or lower cost of goods sold?
  - Or less expenditure on marketing and sales that drive market awareness and penetration rate?
  - What about revenue?
  - Competitor's response?
- Another play with the data - Conduct analysis but fail to gain any insights of the model sensitivity
- You don't want to fail to act on the sensitivity analysis results. If you find any problems with the model, you can fix it

### 4. Scenario Analysis - Overview

- Your baseline model and resulting valuation reflects your current view of the company outlook, i.e. "what is expected"
- Form scenarios by asking "what could also be?"
- Scenarios might be used to gauge upside and downside, and perhaps form a probability-weighted valuation
- Scenarios should reflect another plausible state of the world; not mechanical examination of a parameter range. Consider aspect like the trade-offs, competitive response, and so on
- Scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis are not exclusive to each other

### 5. Scenario Analysis - An initial Teaser

- **Industry Structure** - What if the industry becomes more or less competitive due to new entrants, over-expansion, corporate action, rationalisation, or management shifts?
- **Game theory** - How could the game change? For instance, what if the government or regulatory backdrop is up-ended?
- **Technological change** - What if technology lowers costs or barriers to entry? Effects on prices, demand, ROIC?
- **Growth** - What if the company decides to expand aggressively?
- **Funding-related** - what if access to capital dries up? Does this feed back into the operations? Is bankruptcy plausible?

**Evaluating Estimates - Example:**

### 6. Candidates for Scenario Analysis

- Expansion of business into new markets or products
  - What have the management of the company been talking about?
  - Are they actively trying to reveal new products to the market?
  - You can conduct your story this way
- Change in product penetration or market share
- Corporate transactions that could add or subtract value, e.g. major acquisitions, divestments, change in capital structure
- Shifts in industry structure or competitiveness, e.g. new entrant
- Regulatory change
- Impact of new technology
- Economic scenarios, e.g. boom/bust
- Fluctuations in major input costs, including the industry response
- Cost of capital changes, or funding pressures

### 7. Implications for Assignment

- Scenario analysis is a compulsory part of your company model
- Inclusion of sensitivity is optional, but will be worth additional marks and can enhance your investments case
- What you might do - always link the scenarios to value drivers:
  - Identify any relevant scenarios, and provide analysis of upside potential and/or downside risk around your valuation
  - Provide a table of raw sensitivities to key inputs, plus a summary paragraph highlighting key inputs
- Overlap is possible between scenarios and investment opportunities
- Probability-weighted valuation is optional. (You might prefer to focus on the distribution, rather than a measure of central tendency)

### 8. Traps to avoid

- Take a simple or "naive" view of scenarios
  - **Example:** define different states of economic growth but fail to disclose the relation between drivers and value TLS vs WOW, same drivers?
- Define the company's scenarios (strategies and operations) in isolation
  - **Example:** upside and downside market share forecasts but fail to incorporate competitors reactions
- Define the scenarios around one or two variables, instead of defining a valuation case

## Examples

> [!example] Sensitivity Analysis
> Testing how changes in key assumptions (revenue growth, margins, WACC inputs) affect the valuation outcome.

> [!example] Scenario Analysis
> Creating plausible alternative states of the world (industry changes, regulatory shifts, economic scenarios) to gauge upside and downside potential.

> [!example] Probability-Weighted Valuation
> Combining multiple scenarios with probabilities to estimate expected value distribution.
