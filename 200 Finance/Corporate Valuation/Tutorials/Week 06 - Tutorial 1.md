### Chapter 10 Review Questions

1. Bangalore Bread is an Indian producer of breads and other baked goods. Over the past year, profitability has been strong, and the share price has risen from 15 rupees per share to 25 rupees per share. Financial analysts expect the profit growth to continue. The company has 20 million shares outstanding. Its borrowing is conservative: the company has only 100 million rupees in debt. The debt trades at par, yielding to maturity 50 basis points above Indian risk-free bonds. Bangalore Bread has a market beta of $0.7$. If the Indian risk-free rate is $7\%$, the market risk premium is $5\%$, and the marginal tax rate is $30\%$, what is Bangalore Bread's cost of capital? (Assume that the current capital structure is the target capital structure going forward.)

**Answer:** 9.63%

2. Bangalore Bread is now considering a leveraged recapitalization of the company. Upon announcement, management expects the share price to rise by $10\%$. If the company raises 200 million rupees in new debt to repurchase shares, how many shares can the company repurchase? Assuming those shares, how will management actively manage to the new capital structure, estimate its new market beta. If the interest rate on the company's debt rises to 100 basis points above the Indian risk-free rate, what will its new cost of capital equal? (Assume a debt beta of zero and that the beta of the tax shields will equal the beta of the unlevered firm. In other words, $\beta_D = 0$, and $\beta_{\text{tax shield}} = \beta_U$.) How high would the company's interest rate have to rise in order for the cost of capital to be the same as in Question 1?

3. Your company, EuropeCo (a German conglomerate of food, beverages, and consumer products), has announced its intention to purchase Bangalore Bread. EuropeCo has the same target capital structure as that of Bangalore Bread in Question 2. If the German risk-free rate is $5\%$ and the beta under EuropeCo is $0.9$, what is the cost of capital for Bangalore Bread under EuropeCo control?

4. Suppose that the median price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is 15.0. If the long-run return on equity is $13.5\%$ and the long-run growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to be $6.7\%$ (3.5 percent real growth and 3.2 percent inflation), what is the cost of equity implied by the growth-and-earnings yield value driver formula?

**Chapter 11 formula:**
$$K_e =\frac{E}{P} \times (1-\frac{g}{ROE}) + g$$

= 10.1%

5. Market betas are typically computed with five years of monthly data or two years of weekly data. For computational simplicity, we present only 12 data points in Exhibit 13.13 for ConglomCo, a large conglomerate firm. Using a spreadsheet regression package or other software tool, compute a regression beta for ConglomCo.

$$CAPM = r_f + \beta \times \text{excess market return}$$

$$\text{excess return for stock} = \beta \times \text{excess market returns}$$

Where:
- $\text{excess return for stock} = y$
- $\beta = \text{slope}$
- $\text{excess market returns} = x$

**Exhibit 13.13 ConglomCo and Market Returns**

| Month | ConglomCo (%) | Market (%) |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Month 1 | 1.3 | 1.0 |
| Month 2 | 2.0 | 1.2 |
| Month 3 | 5.0 | 3.4 |
| Month 4 | (1.0) | 0.3 |
| Month 5 | (1.4) | (0.8) |
| Month 6 | 2.2 | 3.7 |
| Month 7 | 6.1 | 4.8 |
| Month 8 | 0.3 | (2.3) |
| Month 9 | (0.4) | (4.5) |
| Month 10 | 3.8 | 3.9 |
| Month 11 | (1.2) | (1.3) |
| Month 12 | 0.0 | 1.8 |

6. You are analyzing a distressed bond with one year to maturity. The bond has a face value of $100$ and pays a coupon rate of $5\%$ per year, with annual coupons. The bond is currently trading at $80$. What is the yield to maturity on the bond? If the probability of default is $35\%$, what is the cost of debt? Assume that upon default, only $50\%$ of face value will be recovered and that remaining coupons will not be paid. If the probability of default rises to $40\%$ but the expected payout in default remains at $50\%$, what do you think will happen to the yield to maturity and the cost of debt? Why?

7. What challenges did the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath pose for estimating a firm's cost of capital? How should one handle these challenges?

- Low rates
- Bonds -> 0
- $R_f$ was very low and inaccurate
- Created a synthetic risk-free rate by adding the expected inflation rate to the long-term historical average real risk-free rate

## Examples

> [!example] WACC Calculation
> Calculate weighted average cost of capital using market values of equity and debt, cost of equity (from CAPM), and cost of debt adjusted for tax.

> [!example] Beta Regression
> Calculate beta using regression analysis: excess stock returns = β × excess market returns.

> [!example] Cost of Debt with Default Risk
> Adjust cost of debt for probability of default and expected recovery rate.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| WACC | Weighted Average Cost of Capital |
| CAPM | $K_e = R_f + \beta \times ERP$ |
| Beta | Slope from regression: excess stock returns vs excess market returns |
| Cost of Debt | Yield to maturity adjusted for default risk and expected recovery |
| Growth-and-Earnings Yield | $K_e = \frac{E}{P} \times (1-\frac{g}{ROE}) + g$ |
