### Chapter 8 Review Questions

1. Exhibit 8.18 displays the income statement and reorganized balance sheet for BrandCo, a consumer products company. Using the methodology outlined in Exhibit 8.5, determine net operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) for years 1 to 6. Assume an operating tax rate of 30 percent. Using the methodology outlined in Exhibit 8.6, determine free cash flow for years 1 to 6.

| Operating working capital | 188.9 | 202.1 | 215.2 | 229.2 | 242.9 | 256.3 | 269.1 |

2. BrandCo currently has 65.6 million shares outstanding. If BrandCo's shares are trading at $57 per share, what is the company's market capitalization (value of equity)? Assuming the market value of debt equals today's book value of debt, what percentage of the company's value is attributable to debt, and what percentage is attributable to equity? When would the market value of debt not equal the book value? Using these weights, compute the weighted average cost of capital. Assume the pretax cost of debt is 8 percent, the cost of equity is 12 percent, and the marginal tax rate is 30 percent.

3. Using the next five years of free cash flow computed in Question 1, an estimated continuing value at the end of year 5, and the weighted average cost of capital computed in Question 2, estimate BrandCo's enterprise value. Assume a long-term growth rate in cash flows of 5 percent and a return on new invested capital (RONIC) of 15 percent.

4. Assuming the market value of debt equals today's book value of debt, what is the intrinsic equity value for BrandCo? What is the value per share? Does the intrinsic equity value per share used to determine the cost-of-capital weightings differ from the share price used in Question 2?

5. What are the three components required to calculate economic profit? Determine BrandCo's economic profit in years 1 to 6.

6. Using the economic profit for years 1 to 5 calculated in Question 5, an estimated continuing value at the end of year 5, and the weighted average cost of capital computed in Question 2, value BrandCo using the economic-profit-based key value driver model. Assume a long-term growth rate in cash flows of 5 percent and a RONIC of 15 percent. Should discounted economic profit be greater than, equal to, or less than discounted free cash flow? Hint: Prior-year invested capital must be used to determine ROIC and capital charge.

### Chapter 12 Review Questions

1. Exhibit 12.13 presents free cash flow and economic-profit forecasts for ApparelCo, a $250 million company that produces men's clothing. ApparelCo is expected to grow revenues, operating profits, and free cash flow at 6 percent per year indefinitely. The company earns a return on new invested capital (RONIC) of 15 percent. The company's cost of capital is 10 percent. Using the key value driver formula, what is the continuing value as of year 5? Using discounted-cash-flow analysis, what is the value of operations for ApparelCo? What percentage of ApparelCo's total operating value is attributable to the continuing value?

2. Since growth is stable for ApparelCo, you decide to start the continuing value with year 3 cash flows (i.e., cash flows in year 3 and beyond are part of the continuing value). Using the key value driver formula (and data provided in Question 1), what is the continuing value as of year 2? Using discounted cash flow, what is the value of operations for ApparelCo? What percentage of ApparelCo's total operating value is attributable to the continuing value? How does this result compare with your answer in Question 1?

| | Today | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 | Continuing value |
|------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|-----------------:|
| Revenues | 250.0 | 265.0 | 280.9 | 297.8 | 315.6 | 334.6 | 354.6 |
| Operating costs | (225.0) | (238.5) | (252.8) | (268.0) | (284.1) | (301.1) | (319.2) |
| Operating profits | 25.0 | 26.5 | 28.1 | 29.8 | 31.6 | 33.5 | 35.5 |
| Operating taxes | (6.3) | (6.6) | (7.0) | (7.4) | (7.9) | (8.4) | (8.9) |
| NOPLAT | 18.8 | 19.9 | 21.1 | 22.3 | 23.7 | 25.1 | 26.6 |
| Net investment | | (7.5) | (8.0) | (8.4) | (8.9) | (9.5) | (10.0) |
| Free cash flow | | 11.3 | 11.9 | 12.6 | 13.4 | 14.2 | 15.1 |

**Economic profit**

| | | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
|------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| NOPLAT | | 19.9 | 21.1 | 22.3 | 23.7 | 25.1 |
| Invested capital $(t-1)$ | | 132.5 | 140.5 | 148.9 | 157.8 | 167.3 |
| Cost of capital, % | | 10.0 | 10.0 | 10.0 | 10.0 | 10.0 |
| Capital charge | | 13.3 | 14.0 | 14.9 | 15.8 | 16.7 |
| Economic profit | | 6.6 | 7.0 | 7.4 | 7.9 | 8.4 |

**Key value drivers, %**  
Return on new invested capital 15; Growth rate 6; Operating taxes 25; Cost of capital 10

5. A colleague suggests that a 6 percent growth rate is too low for revenue, profit, and cash flow growth beyond year 5. He suggests raising growth to 12 percent in the continuing-value period. If NOPLAT equals $26.6 million in year 6, return on new invested capital (RONIC) equals 15 percent, and the cost of capital equals 10 percent, what is the continuing value as of year 5? Is there an alternative model that would perform better? Explain.

6. SuperiorCo earns a return on invested capital of 20 percent on its existing stores. Given intense competition for new store sites, you believe new stores will earn only their cost of capital. Consequently, you set return on new invested capital (RONIC) (8 percent) equal to the cost of capital (8 percent) in the continuing-value formula. A colleague argues that this is too conservative, as SuperiorCo will create value well beyond the forecast period. What is the flaw in your colleague's argument?

## Examples

> [!example] NOPLAT Calculation
> NOPLAT = Operating profits - Operating taxes, used to calculate free cash flows and economic profit.

> [!example] Free Cash Flow
> FCF = NOPLAT + Depreciation - Net Investment, represents cash available to all capital providers.

> [!example] Economic Profit
> Economic Profit = NOPLAT - (Invested Capital × Cost of Capital), measures value creation above required return.

> [!example] Continuing Value
> Value of cash flows beyond the forecast period, calculated using key value driver formula or perpetuity growth model.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| NOPLAT | Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes = Operating profits - Operating taxes |
| Free Cash Flow | NOPLAT + Depreciation - Net Investment |
| Economic Profit | NOPLAT - (Invested Capital × Cost of Capital) |
| Continuing Value | Value of cash flows beyond forecast period |
| Key Value Driver Formula | $CV = \frac{NOPLAT(1-\frac{g}{ROIC})}{WACC-g}$ |
| RONIC | Return on New Invested Capital - return on marginal investments |
