## Key Concepts

### 1. Chapter Overview

**Consumer Behaviour**
People choose the best things they can afford. Previous chapter clarified affordability. This chapter will look at what defines "Best Things" in economic terms.

**Consumption Bundles**
This refers to the complete list of goods and services in a consumer's choice set.
- **Completeness:** Ensure all relevant goods are included when analysing consumer choice.
- **Broader Models:** May include *when, where and circumstances of goods* (e.g., a raft has a distinct value in different environments).

**Two-Good Model**
- Let $x_1$ represent the quantity of one good, and $x_2$ represent the quantity of the other.
- The full consumption bundle is denoted by $(x_1,x_2)$.
- Occasionally, this bundle is abbreviated as $X$.

### 2. Consumer Preferences

**Preference Ranking**
- **Definition:** Consumers can rank any two consumption bundles, such as $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(y_1,y_2)$, based on desirability.
- **Strict Preference**: When a consumer prefers one bundle over another, we write $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$
  - **Example:** If $(x_1, x_2)$ represents more food and entertainment compared to $(y_1, y_2)$, and the consumer consistently chooses $(x_1, x_2)$, it means that $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$

**Indifference**
- **Indifferent Preference:** The consumer would be equally satisfied with either bundle, indicated as $(x_1, x_2) \sim (y_1, y_2)$.
  - **Example:** If a consumer values a bundle with a certain amount of coffee and tea the same as a bundle with slightly more coffee but less tea, they are indifferent between the two bundles.

**Weak Preference**
- **Weak Preference:** If the consumer weakly prefers $(x_1, x_2)$ to $(y_1,y_2)$, meaning they find $(x_1, x_2)$ at least as good as $(y_1,y_2)$, we write $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$.

**Relationships Between Preferences**
1. If $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$ and $(y_1, y_2) \succeq (x_1, x_2)$, then $(x_1, x_2) \sim (y_1, y_2)$
2. If $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$ and the consumer is not indifferent, then $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$

### 3. Assumptions about Preference

Economics make several fundamental assumptions called 'Axioms', here are the main 3:

1. **Completeness**
   - **Definition:** Any two bundles can be compared, so for any bundles $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(y_1,y_2)$:
     - Either $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$
     - Or $(y_1, y_2) \succeq (x_1, x_2)$
     - Or both, meaning the consumer is indifferent $(x_1, x_2) \sim (y_1, y_2)$

2. **Reflexivity**
   - **Definition:** Any bundle is at least as good as itself
     - $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (x_1, x_2)$

3. **Transitivity**
   - **Definition:** If a consumer considers bundle $(x_1, x_2)$ at least as good as bundle $(y_1,y_2)$ and also considers $(y_1,y_2)$ at least as good as $(z_1,z_2)$, then they must consider $(x_1,x_2)$ at least as good as $(z_1,z_2)$.
   - **Mathematically:**
     - $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$, $(y_1, y_2) \succeq (z_1, z_2)$, then $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (z_1, z_2)$

### 4. Indifference Curves

**Overview**
- **Indifference Curves** provide a graphical way to represent consumer preferences that satisfy the three axioms (completeness, reflexivity, and transitivity) along with a few additional technical assumptions.

![[Pasted image 20241029123325.png]]

**Explanation of Graph**
- The axes represent the quantities of two goods a consumer might consume, labelled as $x_1$ and $x_2$.
- Everything in the blue shaded region, the consumer weakly prefers to $(x_1, x_2)$ and everything along the curved line, the consumer is indifferent towards.

**Defining Indifference Curves**
- **Indifference Curve:** The boundary of the weakly preferred set; it represents all bundles that the consumer views as equally desirable to $(x_1, x_2)$
  - This curve contains bundles such that the consumer is indifferent between each one and $(x_1, x_2)$.
  - Example: If a consumer is indifferent between having either two units of coffee and one unit of tea or one unit of coffee and two units of tea, both bundles would lie on the same indifference curve.

**Properties of Indifference Curves**
- **Direction of Preference:** While indifference curves show bundles the consumer finds equally satisfying, they do not indicate which bundles are preferred over others. Small arrows can sometimes be added to show preferred directions, though this is not always done.
- **Distinct Levels of Preference:** Indifference curves that represent different levels of preference cannot intersect.
  - **Explanation:** Suppose that three bundles $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ such that $X \sim Z$, $Z \sim Y$ and $X \sim Y$, and yet $X \succ Y$. This would violate the transitivity axiom, so no two distinct indifference curves can cross.

**Summary of Properties**
- Indifference curves are a flexible tool for illustrating consumer preferences. They can take on many shapes depending on the preferences they represent, as long as they don't cross each other.

### 5. Example of Preferences

**Relationship Between Preferences and Indifference Curves**
- **Purpose:** To illustrate how specific consumer preferences can be illustrated by indifference curves.

![[Pasted image 20241029125327.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
This diagram demonstrates that indifference curves cannot cross. If they did, as shown by points $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, it would mean that $(X \sim Z)$, $(Z \sim Y)$, $(X \succ Y)$ which violates the transitivity axiom.

**Constructing Indifference Curves**
1. **Starting Point:** Begin by selecting a consumption bundle, say $(x_1, x_2)$.
2. **Change in Good 1:** Increase the quantity of good 1 slightly by an amount of $\Delta x_1$ to obtain a new bundle $(\Delta x_1 + x_1, x_2)$
3. **Adjust Good 2:** Determine the required change in good 2, $\Delta x_2$, to make the consumer indifferent between the original and new bundle, resulting in a bundle $(x_1 + \Delta x_1, x_2 + \Delta x_2)$.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process at different points to develop a full indifference curve.

**Key Concept**
- This method helps determine the shape of the indifference curve based on **marginal substitutions** between goods, illustrating how consumers might trade off one good for another while maintaining the same satisfaction level.

### 6. Perfect Substitutes

- **Definition:** Two goods are considered perfect substitutes if the consumer is willing to exchange one for the other at a constant rate.
- **Example:** When you are at the shops buying toilet paper, and they don't have the brand you like, you will swap for another.

![[Pasted image 20241029130138.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
- The **indifference curves** for perfect substitutes are straight lines with a constant slope.
- In the case of toilet paper, if the consumer buys 3 rolls of the main toilet paper and 3 rolls of the off brand toilet paper (6 total), any bundle where $x_1 + x_2 = 6$ will lie on the same indifference curve.

**Slope of Indifference Curves**
- **Constant Slope:** For perfect substitutes, the indifference curve has a constant slope, which represents the trade-off rate between the two goods.
  - **One-to-One Substitution:** If the consumer values one brand of toilet paper the same as a different brand, the slope of the indifference curve is $-1$
  - **Example with Different Rates:** If we plot off brand on the vertical axis, and main brand on the horizontal axis, and the consumer is willing to trade two off brand toilet paper rolls for one main brand, the slope would be $-2$.

### 7. Perfect Complements

- **Definition:** Goods that are always consumed together in fixed proportions.
- **Example:** Left and right shoes. The consumer needs both left and right shoes to gain utility from a pair; having extra left or right shoes alone doesn't increase satisfaction.

![[Pasted image 20241029130934.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
- The **indifference curves** for perfect complements are L-shaped, with each "corner" representing an equal number of each good (e.g., left and right shoe)
- The **vertex of each L-shape** indicates the points where the quantity of left shoes equals the quantity of right shoes.

**Properties of Perfect Complements**
- **Fixed Proportions:** The consumer only benefits from having goods in a specific ratio.
  - **One-to-One Ratio:** For left and right shoes, the consumer is only satisfied when the quantities match.
  - **Example with Different Proportions:** If a consumer always uses two teaspoons of sugar for each cup of tea, the indifference curves are still L-shaped, but each corner represents this fixed proportion (e.g., $(2,1)$, $(4,2)$).

**Direction of Preference**
- Increasing Preference: Moving both goods in fixed proportions (e.g., one more left and one more right shoe) increases utility, so the direction of higher preference is up and to the right.

### 8. Bads

- **Definition:** A bad is a commodity the consumer dislikes. In this example we have two goods:
  1. Pepperoni (a good the consumer likes)
  2. Anchovies (a bad the consumer dislikes)
- Suppose a consumer loves pepperoni but dislikes anchovies on their pizza. They are, however, willing to accept some anchovies if compensated with enough extra pepperoni.
- **Trade-off:** To stay equally satisfied (on the same indifference curve), the consumer would need more pepperoni to offset any increase in anchovies.

![[Pasted image 20241029133000.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
- The indifference curves for this situation slope upward from left to right. This slope means that as the quantity of anchovies (the bad) increases, the consumer requires more pepperoni (the good) to stay equally satisfied.
- Each curve represents a level of satisfaction, where the consumer is indifferent between bundles of pepperoni and anchovies along the same curve.

**Direction of increasing Preference**
- **Down and to the right:** The consumer prefers less of the bad (anchovies) and more of the good (pepperoni).
  - Moving **down** the line and to the right **on** the graph decreases the amount of anchovies whilst increasing the amount of pepperoni, which aligns with the consumer's preferences.

### 9. Neutral Goods

- **Definition:** A neutral good is a commodity that the consumer neither likes nor dislikes; it doesn't impact their satisfaction.
- **Example:** Suppose a consumer loves coffee but is completely neutral about sugar. Here's how their preferences would work:
  - **Coffee** is the good that the consumer cares about. More coffee always makes them happier.
  - **Sugar** is the neutral good. Whether there's a lot of sugar or no sugar in the coffee, it doesn't affect their satisfaction at all.

![[Pasted image 20241029134051.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
- The indifference curves for a neutral good (sugar) are vertical lines.
- This means that the consumer's satisfaction level depends on the quantity of coffee, not the amount of sugar.

**Vertical Indifference Curves**
- The vertical lines indicate that the consumer's utility remains unchanged regardless of the sugar quantity. Only increases in Coffee move the consumer to a higher indifference curve, increasing satisfaction.
- Moving rightward (more coffee) aligns with higher utility, while changes in sugar quantity (up or down) doesn't affect utility.

### 10. Satiation

- **Definition:** When there is an ideal or "bliss point" bundle of goods that provides the highest satisfaction for the consumer. The closer the consumer is to this point, the better off they are. Moving further away from this ideal bundle decreases satisfaction.

![[Pasted image 20241029134529.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
- **Satiation Point:** The bundle $(\bar{x}_1, \bar{x}_2)$ is called the **satiation point** or **bliss point**. This is the most preferred bundle, giving the consumer the highest utility.
- **Indifference Curves:** The indifference curves are concentric around the satiation point. Closer curves to the bliss point represent higher levels of satisfaction, and curves further away represent lowest utility levels.

**How it works**
- **Too Little:** When the consumer has "too little" of both goods, the indifference curves have a **negative slope**, meaning they would prefer more of each to move closer to the bliss point.
- **Too Much:** When they have "too much" of one or both goods, the curves may have a **positive slope**. Here, the extra amount of good(s) becomes undesirable, or a "bad," so the consumer would prefer to reduce it.

> [!example] Satiation Example
> Suppose the consumer's bliss point involves an ideal amount of **chocolate cake** and **ice cream** per week, like **(3,2)** slices and scoops, respectively.
> - If they have less than this (e.g., (2,1)), they are less satisfied and would prefer more of both.
> - If they have more (e.g.,(5,4)), the excess might make them worse off, as having too much cake and ice cream can lead to discomfort. Reducing each good to return closer to (3,2) improves their satisfaction.

**Key Takeaway**
Many goods have an "ideal" amount beyond which more consumption decreases utility. This bliss point represents the consumer's most preferred balance, and moving closer to it increases satisfaction.

### 11. Discrete Goods

- **Definition:** Discrete goods are goods that are only available in whole, indivisible units. Examples include items like cars or houses.
- **Example:** A person may purchase 1 or 2 cars, but not 1.5 cars.

![[Pasted image 20241029135423.png]]

**Graph Explanation**
- Graph A
  - Since Good 1 (e.g., cars) is only available in integer amounts, the **indifference "curves"** appear as discrete points connected by dotted lines.
  - Each point represents a bundle that the consumer is indifferent between, given the whole-unit restriction for good 1.
- Graph B
  - The weakly preferred set is represented by vertical line segments that show all the bundles at least as good as a particular bundle.
  - For example, if $(1, x_2)$ represents 1 car and some amount of good 2 (e.g., money), the vertical line extending from $x_1 =1$ shows all the bundles weakly preferred to $(1,x_2)$.

### 12. Well-Behaved Preferences

**Monotonic Preferences**
![[Pasted image 20241029140134.png]]
- **Definition**: Monotonicity means **more is better**. The consumer prefers to have more of both goods as long as they are "goods" (not something they dislike).
- **Implications**: Indifference curves slope **downward**. Moving up and to the right (having more of both goods) makes the consumer happier. Moving down and to the left makes them less happy.

**Convex Preferences**
![[Pasted image 20241029141104.png]]

**Graph A - Convex Preferences**
- **Definition**: **Balance is better than extremes**. The consumer prefers a balanced mix of goods rather than all of one good and none of the other.
- **Geometric Implication**: The area of preferred bundles is a **convex set** (rounded outward). If you take two bundles in this area and mix them, the consumer will like the mix as much as or more than each extreme.
  - **Example**: A consumer might be fine with one bundle that's mostly coffee and another that's mostly tea, but they would prefer a balanced mix of both.
  - You like bundle A and you like bundle B, but you slightly prefer the weighted average of A and B.

**Graph B - Nonconvex Preferences**
- **Definition**: When preferences are **nonconvex**, the consumer might actually prefer having **extremes** over a balanced mix.

**Graph C - Concave Preferences**
- **Definition**: **Concave preferences** are a strong version of nonconvex preferences, where the consumer prefers to specialize in one good instead of a balanced mix.
  - **Example**: If a consumer likes ice cream and olives separately but dislikes them together, they might prefer 8 ounces of ice cream and 2 ounces of olives, or the reverse, rather than a mix of 5 ounces of each.

**Strict Convexity**
- **Definition**: **Strict convexity** means the consumer strongly prefers a mix of two bundles over either extreme. This means indifference curves are rounded with no flat sections.
  - **Example**: Perfect substitutes (like two brands of bottled water) have convex preferences but not strictly convex preferences because the consumer views them as interchangeable, allowing for flat sections in the curves.

### 13. The Marginal Rate of Substitution

- **Definition:** The **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)** is the slope of an indifference curve at a specific point. It shows the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for another while staying equally happy.

**How MRS works**
- If you take a little bit of Good 1 away from the consumer, you have to give them some of Good 2 to keep them on the same indifference curve.
- The MRS is calculated as the ratio of the change in Good 2 to the change in Good 1.
  $$MRS = \frac{\Delta x_2}{\Delta x_1}$$

![[Pasted image 20241029142417.png]]

In the graph above, the MRS is the slope of the indifference curve, indicating how much of Good 2 the consumer needs to "substitute" for a bit less of Good 1 to remain equally satisfied.

**MRS and Trading at an Exchange Rate**
Imagine the consumer can trade one good for another at a fixed **exchange rate** $E$. For example, they can give up some of Good 1 to get a specific amount of Good 2 in return.

![[Pasted image 20241029142613.png]]

In the graph above, the line with slope $E$ represents the exchange rate. The consumer can move along this line, trading between goods.
- If the slope of the exchange line equals the MRS, the consumer has no reason to trade more; they're already at their best point.
- If the exchange rate differs from the MRS, the consumer will want to trade to reach a better position on their indifference curve.

**Key Takeaway**
The MRS helps us understand how much of one good a consumer needs to give up to stay just as happy with a bit more of another good. It shows the consumer's willingness to trade goods and when they'll be satisfied with their current mix.

### 14. Other Interpretations of MRS

The MRS shows how willing a consumer is to trade one good for another. Another way to think about the MRS is as the marginal willingness to pay for a bit more of one good, using some of the other good as "payment".

- **Example:** Imagine Good 2 is "all other goods" that the consumer can buy (measured in dollars). The MRS of Good 1 for Good 2 tells us how many dollars' worth of "other goods" the consumer would give up to get a bit more of good 1.

**Important Distinctions**
1. Willingness to Pay vs. Actual Price
   - **Willingness to Pay:** This is how much the consumer wants to pay, based on their preferences.
   - **Actual Price:** This depends on the market price of the good. The price they pay may be different from what they're willing to pay.

2. Marginal vs. Large Changes:
   - **Marginal** willingness to pay is for a tiny (marginal) increase in Good 1.
   - **Large Change:** For a bigger increase, willingness to pay could differ since the amount the consumer would give up for a small change might not scale up the same way.

**Key Takeaway**
The MRS measures how much of Good 2 the consumer is willing to give up for a bit more of Good 1. It reflects personal preferences, not the actual cost they would face in the market.

### 15. Behaviour of the MRS

1. **Perfect Substitutes**
   - **MRS is constant**: The MRS is always the same (e.g., $-1$), meaning the consumer is willing to swap one unit of one good for a unit of the other at a fixed rate.
   - **Example**: Red and blue pencils—if the consumer doesn't care about colour, they'll trade one for the other at a constant rate.

2. **Neutrals**
   - **MRS is infinite**: This means one good doesn't affect satisfaction at all, so the consumer doesn't need to trade to stay equally happy.
   - **Example**: The consumer only cares about the amount of pepperoni on their pizza and doesn't care about anchovies.

3. **Perfect Complements**
   - **MRS is zero or infinite**: The consumer only wants the two goods together in fixed proportions. They won't trade one for the other unless they can match their ideal ratio.
   - **Example**: Left and right shoes—having extra of just one shoe doesn't add value unless it matches with the other.

4. **Convex Preferences (Diminishing MRS)**
   - **MRS decreases as one good increases**: The more of Good 1 you have, the less of Good 2 you're willing to give up to get even more of Good 1.
   - **Natural Intuition**: This makes sense because as you get more of one good, you may value it less and be more willing to trade it for something else.
   - **Example**: If you have lots of coffee, you might be willing to give some up to get more tea.
