## Key Concepts

### 1. Normal and Inferior Goods

In this section, we examine how consumer demand for a good changes with variations in income, holding prices constant to isolate the income effect on demand. Economists define *normal goods* as those for which demand rises with income, while *inferior goods* are those for which demand declines as income increases. This distinction illustrates income elasticity in consumer choices and highlights its role in understanding consumption patterns across different income levels.

**Normal Goods:**
- A good is considered normal if demand for it increases when income rises. This direct relationship is represented by:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta m} > 0 $$
  where $\Delta x_1$ is the change in quantity demanded of good 1, and $\Delta m$ is the change in income.
- For example, as a consumer's income grows, they might buy more organic food or high-quality clothing, indicating these are normal goods for that consumer.

**Inferior Goods:**
- A good is classified as inferior if demand decreases as income increases, showing an inverse relationship:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta m} < 0 $$
  where $\Delta x_1$ and $\Delta m$ represent the same variables as above.
- Examples of inferior goods include basic staples like instant noodles or discount store items that consumers might replace with higher-quality alternatives as their income grows.

**Indifference Curves:**
- These curves represent combinations of goods that provide the consumer with equal satisfaction levels. In this context, indifference curves help visualize the demand for both normal and inferior goods as income changes, showing different optimal consumption points.

![[Pasted image 20241101181536.png]]
- **Figure 6.1 (Normal Goods)**: Illustrates how an increase in income, while holding prices constant, shifts the budget line outward. In this example, demand for both goods increases, indicating that both are normal goods.

![[Pasted image 20241101181544.png]]
- **Figure 6.2 (Inferior Goods)**: Demonstrates an outward shift in the budget line due to increased income, but shows reduced demand for one good. This decrease in quantity for one good, despite higher income, signifies it is an inferior good, as seen with well-behaved indifference curves.

**Practical Implications:**
- Normal goods often include high-quality or luxury items, while inferior goods are usually necessities or lower-quality options. Recognising these distinctions helps predict shifts in consumption patterns as economic conditions improve or decline.

**Assumptions in Theory:**
- This analysis assumes stable preferences and competitive markets without changes in price. Such assumptions isolate the income effect, showing how demand changes purely due to income adjustments.

> [!example] Example Analysis
> Consider a consumer deciding between two goods: $good\ 1$ (a luxury good) and $good\ 2$ (a staple item):
> - With increased income, the consumer might buy more of $good\ 1$ and less of $good\ 2$. This behaviour shows $good\ 1$ as a normal good, while $good\ 2$ is an inferior good, replaced as they can afford better options.

### 2. Income Offer Curves and Engel Curves

This section explores how consumer demand varies with income, introducing the *income offer curve* and the *Engel curve* to represent demand patterns at different income levels. The income offer curve (or income expansion path) maps optimal bundles as income increases, while the Engel curve shows the relationship between income and the demand for a specific good, with prices held constant.

**Income Offer Curve (Income Expansion Path):**
- The income offer curve connects the bundles of goods demanded at different income levels, with prices fixed. It illustrates how a consumer's choices evolve as income increases. When both goods are normal, the curve has a positive slope, indicating rising demand for both goods with higher income.
- For instance, if a consumer's income increases steadily, the income offer curve would trace their rising demand for both goods, moving outward in a positive direction.

**Engel Curve:**
- The Engel curve plots the demand for a specific good as a function of income while keeping prices constant. It helps to isolate the effect of income changes on the quantity demanded for one good, such as:
  $$ x_1 = x_1(p_1, p_2, m) $$
  where $x_1$ is the demand for good 1, $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the fixed prices of goods 1 and 2, and $m$ is income.
- This curve is essential for understanding income elasticity of demand for a particular good, as it shows how much of a good is purchased at various income levels.

![[Pasted image 20241101181659.png]]
- **Figure 6.3A (Income Offer Curve)**: This panel illustrates the income offer curve, showing optimal bundles chosen as income increases while prices remain constant. The positive slope suggests both goods are normal goods, with demand rising for each as income grows.

- **Figure 6.3B (Engel Curve)**: This panel presents the Engel curve for good 1, where demand for this good is plotted against income ($m$), holding all prices fixed. It captures how the demand for good 1 changes purely as a result of variations in income.

**Practical Implications:**
- Income offer curves are valuable for predicting how consumers might adjust their consumption bundles as their financial situation improves or worsens. Engel curves, meanwhile, allow firms to understand how demand for individual goods responds to income changes, which aids in pricing and marketing strategies.

**Assumptions in Theory:**
- The analysis assumes stable preferences and fixed prices, isolating income effects on demand. This assumption allows us to attribute changes in demand directly to income fluctuations without interference from price shifts.

### 3. Some Examples

This section examines specific types of preferences—perfect substitutes, perfect complements, Cobb-Douglas, homothetic, and quasilinear preferences—and explores how each affects the shapes of income offer curves and Engel curves. These examples provide insights into different consumption patterns and income effects for each type of preference.

**Perfect Substitutes:**
- When goods are perfect substitutes, the consumer will exclusively choose the good with the lower price. For example, if $p_1 < p_2$, the consumer will consume only good 1 as income rises, resulting in an income offer curve along the horizontal axis.
- The Engel curve for good 1 is a straight line with a slope of $p_1$, as given by:
  $$ x_1 = \frac{m}{p_1} $$
  where $m$ is income. This indicates a linear relationship between income and demand for good 1.

**Perfect Complements:**
- With perfect complements, the consumer consumes goods in fixed proportions. The income offer curve is a diagonal line through the origin, reflecting the fixed ratio in consumption as income changes.
- The Engel curve for good 1 has a slope of $p_1 + p_2$ and can be expressed as:
  $$ x_1 = \frac{m}{p_1 + p_2} $$
  where $m$ is income. This linear Engel curve reflects the proportional increase in demand for both goods as income rises.

**Cobb-Douglas Preferences:**
- For Cobb-Douglas preferences, demand is proportional to income. The income offer curve is a straight line through the origin, showing proportional increases in demand for each good as income rises.
- The Engel curve for good 1 has a slope of $p_1 / a$:
  $$ x_1 = \frac{a \cdot m}{p_1} $$
  where $a$ represents the proportion of income spent on good 1. This linear Engel curve reflects a direct relationship between income and demand for good 1.

**Homothetic Preferences:**
- Homothetic preferences imply that demand for goods increases proportionally with income, maintaining constant ratios between goods. Both income offer curves and Engel curves are straight lines through the origin.
- Homothetic preferences simplify income effects, as the demanded bundle scales proportionally with income changes.

**Quasilinear Preferences:**
- In quasilinear preferences, increases in income affect only one good. For example, if income increases, demand for good 1 remains constant, and all additional income goes toward good 2.
- The Engel curve for good 1 is a vertical line, indicating that its demand remains unchanged with varying income levels.

![[Pasted image 20241101181846.png]]
- **Figure 6.4 (Perfect Substitutes)**: Shows the income offer curve along the horizontal axis and a straight-line Engel curve for good 1, reflecting a constant consumption of the cheaper good as income rises.

![[Pasted image 20241101181838.png]]
- **Figure 6.5 (Perfect Complements)**: Depicts the income offer curve as a diagonal through the origin and a straight-line Engel curve, showing the proportional increase in demand for both goods with income.

![[Pasted image 20241101181824.png]]
- **Figure 6.6 (Cobb-Douglas Preferences)**: Illustrates straight-line income offer and Engel curves, reflecting proportional increases in demand for each good as income rises.

![[Pasted image 20241101181811.png]]
- **Figure 6.7 (Homothetic Preferences)**: Demonstrates straight-line income offer and Engel curves, emphasizing the proportional scaling of demand with income.

![[Pasted image 20241101181757.png]]
- **Figure 6.8 (Quasilinear Preferences)**: Shows a vertical Engel curve for good 1, indicating zero income effect on good 1 and increased demand for good 2 with rising income.

**Consumption Patterns:**
- Different preferences illustrate varied income effects, from proportional increases (Cobb-Douglas and homothetic) to zero income effect (quasilinear).
- Homothetic preferences simplify modelling but are less realistic, while quasilinear preferences can apply to inexpensive goods with minimal budget impact, such as pencils or salt.

**Policy Implications:**
- Understanding income effects is essential in predicting how consumers will respond to income changes, aiding in tax policy design and economic planning.

### 4. Ordinary Goods and Giffen Goods

In this section, we explore how the demand for a good responds to price changes, examining the typical case of *ordinary goods* where demand increases as price decreases, and the exceptional case of *Giffen goods*, where demand decreases as price decreases. This distinction illustrates how different types of preferences can lead to varied demand behaviors, challenging the assumption that lower prices always lead to higher demand.

**Ordinary Goods:**
- For an ordinary good, demand increases when its price decreases, with other prices and income held constant. A decrease in price flattens the budget line, shifting the optimal consumption bundle to a higher quantity of the cheaper good.
- Mathematically, this relationship for an ordinary good can be expressed as:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta p_1} < 0 $$
  where $x_1$ is the quantity demanded of good 1, and $p_1$ is the price of good 1. This inverse relationship between price and quantity is depicted in **Figure 6.9**.

**Giffen Goods:**
- A Giffen good is a good for which demand decreases when its price decreases, due to a unique interaction between income and substitution effects.
- With a Giffen good, a price decrease in good 1 effectively increases purchasing power, leading the consumer to purchase more of other goods instead of the cheaper good. This results in:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta p_1} > 0 $$
  where $x_1$ and $p_1$ retain the same meanings. This positive relationship, which defies typical demand behaviour, is illustrated in **Figure 6.10**.

![[Pasted image 20241101181946.png]]
- **Figure 6.9 (Ordinary Goods)**: Shows the case of an ordinary good, where a price decrease for good 1 results in a flatter budget line and a rightward shift in the optimal choice for good 1, increasing its demand.

![[Pasted image 20241101181940.png]]
- **Figure 6.10 (Giffen Goods)**: Depicts the case of a Giffen good, where a decrease in the price of good 1 results in reduced demand for that good, as purchasing power increases and the consumer reallocates consumption toward other goods.

**Income and Substitution Effects:**
- In ordinary goods, the substitution effect (buying more of the cheaper good) and the income effect (increased purchasing power) work together, resulting in higher demand for the good when its price falls.
- For Giffen goods, the income effect dominates the substitution effect, leading consumers to reallocate their spending to other goods instead. This behaviour is typically observed in inferior goods where an increase in effective purchasing power reduces demand for the cheaper good in favor of higher-quality alternatives.

**Real-World Examples:**
- Giffen goods are rare in practice but may appear in cases of essential yet low-quality goods. For example, when the price of a staple like gruel falls, a consumer might reduce their gruel consumption, reallocating funds to more preferred goods such as milk.

> [!example] Giffen Good Example
> Consider a consumer purchasing two goods: `gruel` (good 1, an inferior good) and `milk` (good 2):
> - If the price of gruel decreases, this consumer might buy less gruel and use the saved income to buy more milk, thereby reducing their consumption of gruel despite the price drop.
> 
> This example illustrates how income effects can dominate substitution effects, producing a positive relationship between price and demand for certain inferior goods, defining them as Giffen goods.

### 5. The Price Offer Curve and the Demand Curve

This section examines how demand for a good changes as its price varies, holding the price of other goods and income constant. The *price offer curve* connects optimal consumption bundles at each price level, while the *demand curve* plots the quantity of a good demanded as a function of its own price, typically displaying a negative slope. Together, these curves illustrate demand sensitivity to price changes and help define the downward-sloping nature of demand.

**Price Offer Curve:**
- The price offer curve shows the bundles of goods a consumer would optimally choose as the price of one good changes, with other prices and income held constant. This is depicted by connecting points on a pivoting budget line as the price of good 1 changes.

**Demand Curve:**
- The demand curve represents the relationship between the quantity demanded of a good and its price, denoted by:
  $$ x_1 = x_1(p_1, p_2, m) $$
  where $x_1$ is the demand for good 1, $p_1$ is its price, and $p_2$ and $m$ are held constant.
- The demand curve generally has a negative slope, indicating that an increase in price ($p_1$) leads to a decrease in demand for good 1. Mathematically, this inverse relationship is shown as:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta p_1} < 0 $$
  which reflects the typical downward slope of demand curves.

![[Pasted image 20241101182119.png]]
- **Figure 6.11A (Price Offer Curve)**: Illustrates the price offer curve, showing how the consumer's optimal bundle changes as the price of good 1 varies, pivoting the budget line around the vertical intercept.

- **Figure 6.11B (Demand Curve)**: Shows the demand curve, plotting the quantity of good 1 demanded against its price. The negative slope indicates that as price decreases, demand increases, consistent with ordinary goods.

**Price Sensitivity and Demand:**
- The price offer curve and demand curve are foundational tools for understanding consumer response to price changes. The downward slope of the demand curve reflects how consumers typically purchase less of a good as its price increases, a key concept in pricing and economic modeling.

**Giffen Goods Exception:**
- In rare cases, such as Giffen goods, the demand curve may have a positive slope, indicating that demand increases with price. This is an unusual scenario but theoretically possible, reinforcing that most demand curves are negatively sloped.

### 6. Substitutes and Complements

In this section, we formally define *substitutes* and *complements* in economics, examining how changes in the price of one good impact the demand for another. Goods are classified as substitutes when an increase in the price of one leads to higher demand for the other, and as complements when an increase in the price of one reduces demand for the other. This distinction helps clarify how related goods interact within a consumer's budget.

**Substitutes:**
- Goods are considered substitutes if the demand for one good increases when the price of the other rises. Formally, good 1 is a substitute for good 2 if:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta p_2} > 0 $$
  where $x_1$ is the demand for good 1, and $p_2$ is the price of good 2. This relationship means that as good 2 becomes more expensive, consumers opt for more of good 1 instead. An example is pencils and pens, where rising pen prices may increase pencil demand.

**Complements:**
- Goods are complements if demand for one good decreases as the price of the other increases. In this case:
  $$ \frac{\Delta x_1}{\Delta p_2} < 0 $$
  where $x_1$ is demand for good 1, and $p_2$ is the price of good 2. For example, coffee and sugar are complements: if coffee prices rise, people may buy less coffee, which also reduces sugar demand.

**Gross Substitutes and Gross Complements:**
- The definitions given here are for *gross substitutes* and *gross complements*, based on observable consumer demand behaviour. These definitions are useful in basic two-good cases but may become complex with multiple goods, where substitution and complement relationships can vary among goods.

**Perfect Substitutes**: For perfect substitutes, demand for one good remains stable or increases when the price of the other good changes. Mathematically, $\Delta x_1 / \Delta p_2$ is positive or zero, indicating that consumers are indifferent or favour the cheaper good.

**Perfect Complements**: For perfect complements, demand for one good decreases when the price of its complement rises. Here, $\Delta x_1 / \Delta p_2$ is negative, reflecting how consumption of paired goods like left and right shoes is linked.

**Consumer Choice Behaviour:**
- Understanding substitutes and complements is vital for predicting how consumers will shift consumption in response to price changes, which is crucial for market strategies and pricing.

**Limitations with More Goods:**
- In cases with more than two goods, the relationship between substitutes and complements becomes less straightforward. For instance, in a multi-good setup, good 1 may be a substitute for good 3, while good 3 might act as a complement to good 1. This makes the two-good case simpler but less universally applicable.

> [!example] Substitutes and Complements Examples
> Consider the case of coffee (good 1) and sugar (good 2):
> - If the price of coffee increases, demand for sugar may decline as people reduce coffee consumption. Here, $\Delta x_1 / \Delta p_2$ is negative, indicating a complementary relationship.
> 
> For substitutes, consider pencils and pens:
> - If pen prices rise, consumers may purchase more pencils, leading to a positive $\Delta x_1 / \Delta p_2$ for pencils in response to pen price increases.

### 7. The Inverse Demand Function

This section introduces the *inverse demand function*, where price is viewed as a function of quantity, rather than quantity as a function of price. The inverse demand function helps determine the price at which consumers are willing to purchase a specific quantity of a good, reflecting the *marginal willingness to pay* for incremental units of that good. This approach is useful in understanding how much consumers are willing to sacrifice in other goods or money to acquire additional units.

**Inverse Demand Function:**
- While the direct demand function shows how quantity demanded varies with price, the inverse demand function represents price as a function of quantity:
  $$ p_1 = \frac{a \cdot m}{x_1} $$
  where $p_1$ is the price of good 1, $x_1$ is the quantity of good 1 demanded, $a$ is a proportional constant, and $m$ represents income. This form applies, for example, to Cobb-Douglas preferences.

**Marginal Willingness to Pay (MWTP):**
- The inverse demand function measures how much consumers are willing to pay for an additional unit of good 1, or conversely, how much they would give up of another good (such as good 2 or money) for a bit more of good 1.
- The price of good 1, in this case, reflects the *marginal rate of substitution (MRS)* between goods 1 and 2, as long as both goods are consumed in positive amounts. The inverse demand function aligns with the MRS:
  $$ |MRS| = \frac{p_1}{p_2} $$

![[Pasted image 20241101182241.png]]
- **Figure 6.15 (Inverse Demand Curve)**: Illustrates the inverse demand curve, showing price as a function of quantity. The curve indicates the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for each unit of good 1, diminishing as the quantity of good 1 increases.

**Economic Interpretation of MRS:**
- When the price of good 2 is held at one, the price of good 1 directly represents how much of good 2 the consumer would trade for an extra unit of good 1, effectively measuring their *marginal willingness to pay*.

**Demand Sensitivity:**
- The inverse demand function reveals that as the quantity of good 1 increases, consumers are willing to pay progressively less for each additional unit, aligning with the principle of diminishing marginal utility. This interpretation supports the idea that demand curves typically slope downwards, reflecting decreasing marginal willingness to pay.

> [!example] Inverse Demand Example
> Consider the Cobb-Douglas demand for good 1:
> - The direct demand function is given by $x_1 = \frac{a \cdot m}{p_1}$. Rearranging this, the inverse demand function becomes:
>   $$ p_1 = \frac{a \cdot m}{x_1} $$
> - Here, $p_1$ represents the price necessary for the consumer to demand exactly $x_1$ units of good 1, illustrating the marginal willingness to pay for each unit as $x_1$ changes.
