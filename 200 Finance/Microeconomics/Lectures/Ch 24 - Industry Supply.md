## Overview

Industry supply covering aggregation of firm supply curves, short-run and long-run industry supply, entry and exit, and economic rent.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Supply Curves and Industry Kinks

- The industry supply curve is the sum of individual firms' supply curves. A "kink" occurs at the price where one firm's supply begins to contribute while another is still inactive or has a different supply rate.
- **Application**: For supply functions like $S_1(p) = p - 10$ and $S_2(p) = p - 15$, the kink occurs where the two supply curves meet or where one begins to supply.

### 2. Impact of Taxes in Different Demand Elasticities

- In the **short run** with **inelastic demand** (e.g., cigarettes), consumers bear most of the tax burden, so prices paid rise significantly.
- In the **long run**, if demand becomes **elastic**, firms will bear more of the tax burden, resulting in less of a price increase for consumers.
- **Application**: Analyze how elasticity shifts the tax impact on price in short vs. long run.

### 3. Economic Rent and High Prices

- High prices near a campus could be due to demand, not necessarily rent costs. Economic rent is the extra payment due to scarce, desirable factors (e.g., location), but high prices are set by what consumers are willing to pay.
- **Application**: Evaluate if high prices are due to rent or consumer willingness to pay for convenience.

### 4. Long-Run Equilibrium and Profit

- In **long-run equilibrium**, with free entry and exit, firms should make zero economic profit (covering all costs but no extra profit).
- **Application**: Understand that firms breaking even (no losses) defines a stable, competitive equilibrium.

### 5. Entry and Exit Determinants

- Entry and exit in an industry depend on profit opportunities. Positive profits attract new firms, and losses lead firms to exit.
- **Application**: Identify that entry and exit adjust until firms in the industry make zero economic profit.

### 6. Industry Supply Curve Slope

- The more firms in an industry, the **flatter** the long-run supply curve because increased competition makes the industry supply more responsive to price.
- **Application**: Recall that long-run supply elasticity increases with more firms.

### 7. Positive Profits and the Competitive Model

- Apparent long-run profits (e.g., for NYC cab operators) may include economic rent from fixed factors (like limited licenses), which do not violate competitive principles if all other costs are covered.
- **Application**: Consider economic rent as part of the cost structure in restricted-entry markets.
