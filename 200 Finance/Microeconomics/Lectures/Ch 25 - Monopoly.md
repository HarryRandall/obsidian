## Overview

Monopoly covering monopoly basics, natural monopoly, regulation of natural monopolies, why monopolies form, and examples of monopolistic practices.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Monopoly Basics

- A monopoly is when there's only one firm in an industry.
- A monopolist sets its price where **marginal revenue (MR)** equals **marginal cost (MC)** to maximise profits, leading to prices higher than in a competitive market.
- This markup on the marginal cost depends on the **elasticity of demand** (how sensitive consumers are to price changes).
- Monopolies typically produce less output than would be ideal for consumers and charge more, leading to **deadweight loss** (loss of overall economic efficiency).

### 2. Natural Monopoly

- Occurs when a firm has very high fixed costs (like setting up a power grid) but low marginal costs for serving additional customers.
- Public utilities like gas, electricity, or water are often natural monopolies because it's costly to build infrastructure but cheap to add users.

> [!example] Gas Company Example
> A gas company incurs huge costs to install pipes but can provide extra gas cheaply once pipes are in place.

### 3. Regulating Natural Monopolies

- If allowed to set prices freely, a natural monopoly could restrict output and charge high prices, creating **Pareto inefficiency** (a situation where resources aren't allocated optimally).
- Government regulation or operation of natural monopolies is common.
  - **Regulation**: Sets prices so that the monopoly can cover its costs (average cost pricing), usually resulting in a price-output level that covers costs without being fully efficient.
  - **Government Ownership**: Governments might directly operate some natural monopolies (e.g., public transport) and may subsidise them to cover costs and keep prices low.

### 4. Why Monopolies Form

1. **Minimum Efficient Scale (MES)**:
   - If the **MES** (minimum level of output that minimises average cost) is large relative to market demand, only one firm can operate profitably.
   - Conversely, if MES is small, many firms can enter, leading to a competitive market.

> [!example] Airline Example
> In small markets, only one airline may be viable, creating a monopoly, while in large markets, multiple airlines can compete.

2. **Market Conditions & Policy**:
   - Policies like **restrictive trade policies** (e.g., tariffs) can reduce market size and encourage monopolies by limiting competition.
   - Larger, open markets (e.g., global markets) promote competition by allowing multiple firms to enter.

3. **Cartels**:
   - Firms might collude (secretly agree) to limit output and raise prices, functioning as a cartel. This is illegal in many places.

> [!example] De Beers Diamond Cartel
> De Beers in the diamond industry controls the market through agreements with other producers, limiting diamond supply and influencing prices.

4. **First-Mover Advantage**:
   - When one firm enters a market first, it may build enough capacity to discourage new competitors by threatening to lower prices if they enter, thereby maintaining its monopoly.

### 5. Examples of Monopolistic Practices

1. **De Beers Diamond Cartel**:
   - Controls diamond supply, pricing, and marketing to maintain high prices by limiting diamonds on the market.

2. **Auction Pools**:
   - Dealers collude to bid low in public auctions and hold private auctions among themselves, keeping prices low for initial sellers and splitting the profits afterward.

3. **DRAM Price Fixing**:
   - DRAM producers like Infineon conspired to set high prices for computer memory chips, leading to fines and legal penalties.

### 6. Solving Math Problems

- Convert $D(p)$ into $Q$.
- $R$ revenue is found by $R = p \cdot Q$
- $MR$ is found by $\frac {\Delta R} {\Delta Q}$ it's the derivative of R
- $MC$ is found by $\frac {\Delta c} {\Delta Q}$ it's the derivative of the cost function
- Optimal Output is when $MR = MC$ solving for $Q$
- Substitute $Q$ back into the original demand function.
