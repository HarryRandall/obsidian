## Overview

In this chapter, we combine budget constraints with consumer preferences to explore how consumers make choices. The economic model of consumer choice states that people aim to select the best bundle of goods they can afford.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Optimal Choice

In this section, we explore how consumers choose the best bundle of goods given their budget.

**Summary**
- Goal: Find the highest indifference curves that the consumer can reach within their budget.
- Process: As we move along the budget line, we look for the point where the highest indifference curve touches it. This point represents the optimal bundle of goods, labelled as $(x_1^*,x_2^*)$ in the graph.

**Key Points**
1. **Tangency Condition:** At the optimal point, the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line. This means the slope of the indifference curve matches the slope of the budget line at this point. If they didn't match, the curve would cross the line, implying a higher preference bundle could be reached within the budget, contradicting optimality.

2. **Exceptions:**
   1. **Kinky Tastes:** Sometimes, indifference curves have a "kink" at the optimal choice, where no tangent exists.
   2. **Boundary Optimum:** In cases where the optimal choice includes zero consumption of a good, the slope of the indifference curve doesn't match the budget line.

3. **Necessity vs. Sufficiency:**
   1. **Necessary Condition:** The tangency condition is necessary for an optimal point in most cases, but not always sufficient. For example, there might be multiple tangency points, not all of which are optimal.
   2. **Sufficiency (Convex Preferences):** With convex preferences, any point that meets the tangency condition is optimal. For strictly convex preferences, there will only be one optimal choice along the budget line.

4. **Economic Meaning**: The optimal point is where the MRS (rate at which the consumer is willing to trade one good for another) matches the price ratio. This alignment implies the consumer values the exchange offered by the market, achieving the best balance of goods within their budget.

**Graphs**

This graph shows an optimal choice where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line.

This graph depicts "kinky tastes", where the indifference curve doesn't have a well-defined tangent.

This graph displays a boundary optimum where one good isn't consumed.

This graph demonstrates multiple tangency points, indicating that the tangency condition alone isn't always enough to identify the optimal choice.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Optimal Choice | Best bundle consumer can afford - highest indifference curve within budget |
| Tangency Condition | At optimum, indifference curve tangent to budget line - MRS equals price ratio |
| Kinky Tastes | Preferences with kinks where no tangent exists |
| Boundary Optimum | Optimal choice where one good has zero consumption |
| MRS | Marginal Rate of Substitution - slope of indifference curve |
| Price Ratio | $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ - slope of budget line |
