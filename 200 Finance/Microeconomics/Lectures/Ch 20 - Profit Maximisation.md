## Key Concepts

### 1. Profits

*Profits* are defined as the difference between a firm's total revenues and its total costs. When calculating economic profits, it is crucial to include all *opportunity costs*, which represent the value of inputs in their best alternative use. This section introduces the formula for profits, taking into account both revenues from outputs and the costs of inputs, measured at their current market values.

**Profit Formula:**
- For a firm producing $n$ outputs $(y_1, \dots, y_n)$ and using $m$ inputs $(x_1, \dots, x_m)$, with output prices $(p_1, \dots, p_n)$ and input prices $(w_1, \dots, w_m)$, profits $(\pi)$ are given by:
  $$ \pi = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i y_i - \sum_{i=1}^m w_i x_i $$
  where:
  - $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i y_i$: Total revenue from outputs.
  - $\sum_{i=1}^m w_i x_i$: Total cost of inputs, valued at their current market prices.

**Opportunity Costs:**
- Economic profits consider *opportunity costs*, valuing inputs based on what they could earn in their best alternative use. For example:
  - If an owner-operator of a firm works in their business, the value of their labour input should reflect the wage they could earn elsewhere.
  - If a farmer uses their own land, the land's cost should reflect its potential rental income if leased to others.

**Economic vs. Accounting Profits:**
- Accounting profits may not align with economic profits, as they typically use historical costs rather than current market values. Economic profits focus on the true value of inputs based on current opportunities rather than past purchase prices.

**Flow Units in Profit Calculation:**
- Inputs and outputs are generally measured in terms of flows, such as labour hours per week or machine hours per week, and input prices correspond to these flows. For example, wages are expressed in dollars per hour, and machine rental rates may reflect what it costs to lease machinery over a specified time period.

> [!example] Bakery Example
> Consider a small bakery that produces bread (output $y$) using flour, labour, and oven time as inputs:
> - **Revenue**: Total revenue from selling bread is based on the price per loaf and the quantity sold.
> - **Cost**: Flour cost includes current market prices; labour cost reflects the hourly wage of workers, and oven time is valued at its implicit rental rate (cost to own and use the oven over the time period).
> - **Opportunity Cost**: If the bakery owner works there, the cost should include the wage they forgo by not working elsewhere, representing their labour's opportunity cost.

### 2. The Organization of Firms

In a capitalist economy, *firms* operate as legal entities but are ultimately controlled by individuals who own them. These firms can be organised as *proprietorships*, *partnerships*, or *corporations*, each with distinct structures, lifespans, and approaches to management. The organisational structure influences the objectives and day-to-day operations of the firm.

**Types of Firm Organisation:**
- **Proprietorship**: A business owned and managed by a single individual. The owner has direct control and typically aims to maximise profits or pursue personal goals.
- **Partnership**: A firm owned by two or more individuals. The business's existence depends on the mutual agreement of all partners, and ownership ceases if a partner exits or passes away.
- **Corporation**: A separate legal entity owned by shareholders, whose lifespan extends beyond that of its individual owners. Corporations can continue indefinitely, as ownership is distinct from control.

**Separation of Ownership and Control:**
- In corporations, ownership is usually separate from management, leading to a division between *owners* (shareholders) and *managers* (those running the company). Owners must define objectives for managers to follow, often focusing on *profit maximisation*, and ensure these goals are pursued.

**Objectives of Firm Owners:**
- In proprietorships and partnerships, owners are directly involved in decision-making and can pursue profit or non-profit objectives at their discretion.
- In corporations, the primary objective is typically profit maximisation, although owners can influence management to pursue other goals aligned with corporate responsibility or social impact.

> [!example] Retail Business Example
> Consider a small retail business:
> - If it is organised as a **proprietorship**, the owner directly manages the business, prioritising their personal or financial goals.
> - If the business is a **partnership**, partners share decision-making and responsibility, and the firm's continuity depends on their cooperation.
> - As a **corporation**, ownership could be distributed among shareholders, while a board of directors and appointed managers oversee operations, focusing on sustainable growth and profitability.

### 3. Profits and Stock Market Value

For firms with ongoing production processes, *profits* need to be evaluated over time, reflecting both costs and revenues that occur across multiple periods. In a world with *perfect certainty*, the value of a firm is determined by the *present value* of expected future profits, which is reflected in the firm's *stock market value*. By maximising stock market value, firms maximise shareholder wealth, aligning with the goal of profit maximisation over time.

**Present Value of Future Profits:**
- When a firm's future profits are known with certainty, the *present value* of these profits represents the firm's current value. This valuation includes the entire stream of expected future earnings, discounted at an appropriate interest rate.

**Stock Market Value and Ownership:**
- Corporations distribute ownership through *stock shares*, with the share price representing the present value of expected future dividends. The *total stock market value* of the firm equals the sum of the present value of anticipated dividends, reflecting the firm's future profit potential.

**Maximising Stock Market Value:**
- For shareholders, maximising stock market value aligns with their financial interests, as it increases the value of the shares they hold. In a world of certainty, maximising the present value of future profits aligns directly with maximising stock market value.

**Uncertainty and Profit Maximisation:**
- Under uncertainty, maximising profit becomes ambiguous because profit outcomes are not guaranteed. However, maximising stock market value still provides a clear objective, as the share price reflects the market's valuation of the firm's profit potential, factoring in risk and expected returns.

> [!example] Manufacturing Firm Example
> Consider a manufacturing firm planning to build a factory that will generate profits for the next 50 years:
> - The firm calculates the *present value* of expected future profits from the factory, discounted at the current interest rate. This value is reflected in the firm's stock market valuation, as investors view the factory's potential as part of the firm's long-term profit-generating capacity.
> - By maximising this present value, the firm aligns with shareholders' interests, as the future profit stream supports the value of dividends and share price.

### 4. The Boundaries of the Firm

The *boundaries of the firm* involve decisions about whether to produce goods and services internally (make) or to source them from external suppliers (buy). This "make or buy" decision extends to all types of services and goods a firm uses, and it is influenced by factors like cost, availability, quality, and market structure.

**Make or Buy Decision:**
- Firms constantly assess whether to produce certain services or goods internally or source them externally. This decision considers factors such as:
  - **Cost**: Is it cheaper to make or buy?
  - **Capabilities**: Does the firm have the expertise?
  - **Market Availability**: Are there quality external providers available?

**Impact of Market Structure:**
- Firms prefer to buy services from competitive markets, where multiple providers ensure better prices and quality. The hierarchy of preferences is:
  - **Competitive External Market**: Ideal due to competitive pricing and service quality.
  - **Internal Monopoly**: Less ideal due to potential inefficiencies, but keeps funds within the firm.
  - **External Monopoly**: Least desirable as it often results in higher costs and lower service quality.

**Technological Influence on Firm Boundaries:**
- Advances in technology have allowed firms to outsource many services they once managed internally, such as photocopying and food services. Specialised external providers can often deliver these services at higher quality and lower cost due to economies of scale and focused expertise.

> [!example] Photocopying Services Example
> Consider a corporate office deciding whether to manage its *photocopying services* internally or outsource:
> - **Competitive Urban Market**: If located in a city with multiple photocopying providers, the firm could outsource for competitive rates and high quality.
> - **Internal Option**: If outsourcing is unavailable or uncompetitive, the firm might set up an internal photocopying unit, accepting potential inefficiencies to keep costs within the organisation.
> - **External Monopoly**: For rural locations with limited providers, outsourcing may be costly and inefficient, making an internal solution potentially more attractive.

### 5. Fixed and Variable Factors

In production, *fixed factors* are inputs that cannot be easily adjusted in the short run, while *variable factors* are those that can be used in flexible amounts. This distinction is crucial for understanding a firm's constraints over different time periods, with the short run characterised by fixed factors and the long run allowing all factors to be variable.

**Fixed and Variable Factors:**
- **Fixed Factors**: Inputs that a firm cannot adjust in the short run due to contractual or physical limitations (e.g., building leases, large machinery). Fixed factors must be paid for regardless of output level, even if it is zero.
- **Variable Factors**: Inputs that can be adjusted in both the short run and long run to meet production needs, such as raw materials and hourly labour.

**Short Run vs. Long Run:**
- In the *short run*, some factors are fixed, limiting a firm's flexibility in adjusting production. The fixed costs associated with these factors could result in negative profits if the firm is unable to cover them with output revenue.
- In the *long run*, all factors are variable, allowing the firm to adjust all inputs to optimise production or even go out of business if necessary. The minimum profit in the long run is zero.

**Quasi-Fixed Factors:**
- Quasi-fixed factors are inputs that only need to be paid for if the firm produces a positive output. For instance, electricity for lighting may be unnecessary if production is zero, but a fixed amount is required once production begins. Quasi-fixed factors offer flexibility based on output levels.

> [!example] Restaurant Example
> Consider a restaurant with a fixed lease on its premises:
> - **Fixed Factor**: The lease on the building is a fixed factor, requiring payment regardless of the restaurant's operational status. If it temporarily closes, it must still cover this lease cost.
> - **Variable Factor**: Ingredients and hourly staff wages are variable factors that can be adjusted based on demand and operational needs.
> - **Quasi-Fixed Factor**: Utility expenses like electricity for lighting may be quasi-fixed, required only if the restaurant opens and produces a positive output.

### 6. Short-Run Profit Maximisation

In the *short-run profit maximisation* problem, a firm maximises profits by adjusting variable inputs while keeping fixed inputs constant. For a production function with a fixed input (e.g., $x_2$) and a variable input (e.g., $x_1$), the firm maximises profit by choosing the optimal level of $x_1$.

**Profit Maximisation Formula:**
- The firm's profit maximisation problem can be written as:
  $$ \max_{x_1} \, \pi = p f(x_1, x_2) - w_1 x_1 - w_2 x_2 $$
  where:
  - $p$: Price of output.
  - $f(x_1, x_2)$: Production function.
  - $w_1$, $w_2$: Prices of inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$.
  - $x_2$: Fixed input level in the short run.

**Optimal Condition for Factor Usage:**
- For the profit-maximising choice of $x_1$, the firm should adjust $x_1$ until the value of its marginal product equals its price:
  $$ p \cdot MP_1(x^*_1, x_2) = w_1 $$
  where $MP_1(x_1, x_2)$ is the marginal product of $x_1$. This rule implies that the additional revenue from the marginal product of $x_1$ should equal the cost of $x_1$.

**Decision Rule for Adjusting Input:**
- If the *value of the marginal product* exceeds the cost ($p \cdot MP_1 > w_1$), the firm should increase $x_1$ to raise profits.
- If the value of the marginal product is less than the cost ($p \cdot MP_1 < w_1$), the firm should reduce $x_1$.

**Graphical Representation (Isoprofit Lines):**
![[Pasted image 20241101184639.png]]
- In **Figure 20.1**, the firm maximises profit by choosing the point where the production function meets the highest possible *isoprofit line*. Isoprofit lines represent combinations of inputs and outputs that yield constant profit levels, given by:
  $$ y = \frac{\pi}{p} + \frac{w_2}{p} x_2 + \frac{w_1}{p} x_1 $$
  These lines have a slope of $\frac{w_1}{p}$ and vary in vertical intercept based on profit level.

> [!example] Factory Example
> Consider a factory with a fixed number of machines ($x_2$) and a variable number of workers ($x_1$):
> - The factory maximises profit by hiring additional workers until the revenue from each worker's marginal product equals their wage. If workers produce additional output worth more than their wages, the factory hires more workers. Once wages exceed the marginal product value, hiring stops.

### 7. Comparative Statics

*Comparative statics* is the analysis of how a firm's optimal choice of inputs and output changes in response to variations in input and output prices. Using geometric interpretations, we can understand how adjustments in factor prices or output prices affect the firm's profit-maximising decisions.

![[Pasted image 20241101184759.png]]

**Effect of Factor Price ($w_1$) on Demand for Factor 1:**
- When the price of factor 1 ($w_1$) increases, the *isoprofit line* becomes steeper, as shown in Figure 20.2A. This change pushes the tangency point between the isoprofit line and the production function further left, leading to a reduction in the optimal quantity of factor 1.
- This result implies that as the price of an input rises, the demand for that input decreases, meaning that *factor demand curves slope downward*.

**Effect of Output Price ($p$) on Factor Demand and Output Supply:**
- A decrease in the output price ($p$) also makes the isoprofit line steeper (Figure 20.2B), which reduces the profit-maximising quantity of factor 1. With a reduction in the use of factor 1 and factor 2 fixed, the supply of output decreases.
- This result implies that as output price decreases, the firm supplies less output, confirming that the *supply function slopes upward*.

**Effect of the Price of Fixed Factor 2 ($w_2$):**
- Since factor 2 is fixed in the short run, changes in its price ($w_2$) do not affect the slope of the isoprofit line or the quantity of factor 1 used. Thus, changes in $w_2$ only influence the firm's profits but have no effect on the choice of factor 1 or output supply.

**Downward-Sloping Factor Demand:**
- The comparative statics results demonstrate that increases in input prices decrease input demand, aligning with the law of downward-sloping demand for production factors.

**Upward-Sloping Output Supply:**
- The results also indicate that higher output prices lead to greater supply, supporting the theory that supply functions typically slope upwards in response to rising prices.

> [!example] Factory Example
> Consider a factory that uses two types of labour, $x_1$ (hourly workers) and $x_2$ (supervisors):
> - If the wage rate of hourly workers ($w_1$) rises, the firm will likely reduce its demand for $x_1$ by employing fewer hourly workers.
> - If the price of the product decreases, the firm's incentive to produce diminishes, leading it to reduce its use of both labour inputs if possible, thus reducing output.
> - Changes in supervisor wages ($w_2$) in the short run have no immediate effect on labour demand or output but do impact overall profitability.

### 8. Profit Maximisation in the Long Run

In the *long run*, firms can adjust all input levels to maximise profits, unlike in the short run where some factors remain fixed. The goal is to find the optimal levels of all inputs that maximise profit, given the production function and input prices.

**Long-Run Profit Maximisation Problem:**
- The long-run profit maximisation objective can be formulated as:
  $$ \max_{x_1, x_2} \, \pi = p \cdot f(x_1, x_2) - w_1 x_1 - w_2 x_2 $$
  where:
  - $p$: Price of output.
  - $f(x_1, x_2)$: Production function.
  - $w_1$, $w_2$: Prices of inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$.
  - In the long run, both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are variable, so the firm chooses the optimal levels for each.

**Optimal Condition for Each Factor:**
- For long-run profit maximisation, the value of the marginal product for each factor should equal its price:
  $$ p \cdot MP_1(x^*_1, x^*_2) = w_1 $$
  $$ p \cdot MP_2(x^*_1, x^*_2) = w_2 $$
  where $MP_1$ and $MP_2$ are the marginal products of factors $x_1$ and $x_2$, respectively. These conditions ensure that neither input can be increased to raise profits further.

**Factor Demand Curves:**
- The equations above form a system of two equations with two unknowns, $x^*_1$ and $x^*_2$. Solving these equations provides the optimal levels of each factor as a function of their respective prices, resulting in the *factor demand curves*.

**Balancing Input Costs and Output Revenue:**
- For profit maximisation, each input is used to the point where its cost equals the revenue generated by its marginal product, preventing unnecessary expenses on inputs that do not yield sufficient returns.

**Factor Demand in Response to Price Changes:**
- Knowing the behaviour of marginal products as functions of $x_1$ and $x_2$ allows firms to adjust factor usage in response to changes in input prices, guiding efficient long-run decisions.

> [!example] Manufacturing Firm Example
> Consider a manufacturing firm deciding on the optimal use of labour ($x_1$) and machinery ($x_2$):
> - If the marginal product of labour, adjusted for output price ($p \cdot MP_1$), exceeds the wage rate ($w_1$), the firm will hire more labour.
> - If the value of additional output from an extra machine exceeds the cost of the machine ($w_2$), the firm increases machinery use until marginal cost equals marginal revenue for both inputs.

### 9. Inverse Factor Demand Curves

The *inverse factor demand curve* represents the relationship between a factor's price and the quantity of that factor demanded by a firm. Unlike the standard factor demand curve, which shows how quantity demanded changes with price, the inverse factor demand curve reflects the price required to induce demand for a given quantity of the factor.

**Inverse Factor Demand:**
- The inverse factor demand curve shows the price that must be set for a factor (e.g., $w_1$) to induce the firm to demand a particular quantity of that factor (e.g., $x_1$), while holding the other factor ($x_2$) fixed.
- This curve is derived from the profit-maximisation condition:
  $$ p \cdot MP_1(x_1, x^*_2) = w_1 $$
  where:
  - $p$: Output price.
  - $MP_1(x_1, x^*_2)$: Marginal product of factor 1, given the optimal choice of factor 2 ($x^*_2$).
  - $w_1$: Price of factor 1.

![[Pasted image 20241101185000.png]]

**Shape of the Inverse Factor Demand Curve:**
- The curve is *downward-sloping*, reflecting the diminishing marginal product of factor 1. As $x_1$ increases, its marginal product decreases, meaning that a lower price ($w_1$) is required to maintain demand at higher levels of $x_1$.

**Pricing to Induce Demand:**
- The inverse factor demand curve provides insight into the pricing required to induce firms to demand a specific quantity of an input. For example, if a firm needs a higher quantity of labour, it will only demand it if the wage rate aligns with the reduced marginal productivity at that higher quantity.

**Optimal Input Price for Given Demand:**
- The inverse factor demand curve enables firms to determine the price point needed to achieve optimal demand for a factor, balancing marginal cost with marginal product.

> [!example] Factory Example
> Consider a factory using two types of inputs: *machinery* ($x_2$) and *labour* ($x_1$):
> - To demand a high quantity of labour ($x_1$), the factory requires a lower wage rate ($w_1$), given that the marginal productivity of additional workers decreases as more are hired.
> - If labour becomes less productive at higher quantities, the inverse factor demand curve will reflect the necessary reduction in $w_1$ to justify an increase in labour demand.

### 10. Profit Maximisation and Returns to Scale

In competitive markets, there is a critical relationship between profit maximisation and returns to scale. Understanding this relationship reveals why firms in such markets often settle at zero economic profits in the long run.

**Long-Run Profit Maximisation:**
- A firm producing a long-run profit-maximising output level $y^* = f(x^*_1, x^*_2)$ utilises inputs $(x^*_1, x^*_2)$, generating profits given by:
  $$
  \pi^* = p y^* - w_1 x^*_1 - w_2 x^*_2
  $$
  - If the firm operates under *constant returns to scale*, doubling its input usage should also double its output.

**Implications of Doubling Inputs:**
- If the firm doubles its inputs and, consequently, its output, its profits would also double, which contradicts the initial assumption that the firm was profit maximising. Thus, if the original profit level was positive, it cannot be a long-run equilibrium because profits would continue to rise indefinitely.

**Zero Long-Run Profit Level:**
- The only sustainable long-run profit level for a competitive firm exhibiting constant returns to scale is zero. If profits were positive, the firm would continue to expand, while if they were negative, the firm would exit the market.

**Reasons for Zero Long-Run Profits**

1. **Inefficiencies from Expansion:**
   - If a firm expands excessively, it may encounter operational inefficiencies. The assumption of constant returns to scale may break down, leading to *decreasing returns to scale* due to coordination problems.

2. **Market Dominance:**
   - As a firm grows, it might dominate its market, losing the incentive to behave competitively. In such cases, the firm could exploit its market power to influence prices rather than accepting them, which moves it away from the profit-maximising behaviour of competitive firms.

3. **Market Dynamics:**
   - If one firm achieves positive profits with a constant returns to scale technology, other firms with access to the same technology would also pursue expansion. This collective increase in output would lower the market price, thus reducing profits for all firms.

**Conclusion**

The relationship between profit maximisation and returns to scale in competitive markets leads to the conclusion that firms cannot sustain positive economic profits in the long run. If they could, it would prompt additional firms to enter the market, driving down prices until profits reach zero. Consequently, zero profit becomes the equilibrium state in competitive markets with constant returns to scale, as firms adjust their output and operational strategies accordingly.

### 11. Revealed Profitability

When a profit-maximising firm makes its choices regarding inputs and outputs, it reveals two key aspects:
1. The chosen inputs and outputs represent a feasible production plan.
2. These choices are more profitable than any other feasible alternatives.

**Profit Comparison Across Time:**
- Consider a firm at two different times with different price sets:
  - At time $(t)$: prices $(p_t, w^t_1, w^t_2)$ and choices $(y_t, x^t_1, x^t_2)$.
  - At time $(s)$: prices $(p_s, w^s_1, w^s_2)$ and choices $(y_s, x^s_1, x^s_2)$.
- If the production function is unchanged and the firm is profit-maximising, the following inequalities must hold:
  $$
  p_t y_t - w^t_1 x^t_1 - w^t_2 x^t_2 \geq p_t y_s - w^t_1 x^s_1 - w^t_2 x^s_2
  $$
  $$
  p_s y_s - w^s_1 x^s_1 - w^s_2 x^s_2 \geq p_s y_t - w^s_1 x^t_1 - w^s_2 x^t_2
  $$

**Weak Axiom of Profit Maximisation (WAPM):**
- If either of these inequalities were violated, the firm could not have been profit-maximising with an unchanging technology. The satisfaction of these inequalities is a fundamental axiom of profit-maximising behaviour.

**Comparative Statics:**
- If we observe two time periods where these inequalities are satisfied, we can derive a comparative statics statement about the behaviour of factor demands and output supplies when prices change.
  $$
  -p_s y_t + w^s_1 x^t_1 + w^s_2 x^t_2 \geq -p_s y_s + w^s_1 x^s_1 + w^s_2 x^s_2
  $$
- Adding this to equation $(20.2)$ gives:
  $$
  (p_t - p_s)y_t - (w^t_1 - w^s_1)x^t_1 - (w^t_2 - w^s_2)x^t_2 \geq (p_t - p_s)y_s - (w^t_1 - w^s_1)x^s_1 - (w^t_2 - w^s_2)x^s_2
  $$
- Rearranging leads to:
  $$
  (p_t - p_s)(y_t - y_s) - (w^t_1 - w^s_1)(x^t_1 - x^s_1) - (w^t_2 - w^s_2)(x^t_2 - x^s_2) \geq 0
  $$

**Final Result:**
- Defining changes in prices and outputs gives us:
  $$
  \Delta p \Delta y - \Delta w_1 \Delta x_1 - \Delta w_2 \Delta x_2 \geq 0
  $$
- This indicates that the change in the price of output times the change in output, minus the change in each factor price times the change in that factor, must be nonnegative. This equation arises directly from the definition of profit maximisation and contains all comparative statics results about profit-maximising choices.

**Implications of Price Changes:**
- For instance, if the price of output increases while factor prices remain constant, the profit-maximising supply curve must have a positive slope, indicating that the quantity supplied will increase.
- Conversely, if the price of a factor increases, the demand for that factor will decrease, reflecting a negative slope of the factor demand curve.

**Conclusion:**
- The simple inequalities stemming from WAPM and their implications in equation $(20.7)$ provide robust observable restrictions on firm behaviour, allowing for the estimation of the production function from observed choices.
