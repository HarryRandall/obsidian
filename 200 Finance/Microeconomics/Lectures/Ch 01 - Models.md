## Key Concepts

### 1. Constructing a Model

**Role of Models in Economics**
Economic models are simplified representations of reality, focusing on essential features while excluding irrelevant details. This simplification allows economists to analyse and understand complex social phenomena effectively.

> [!example] Example of Apartment Market
> This example model focuses on the market for apartments in a medium-sized college town. Here, apartments are categorised into two types:
> 1. Inner Ring Apartments: Closer to the university and more desirable to students
> 2. Outer Ring Apartments: Farther away, requiring travel; priced at a fixed level.

**Exogenous vs Endogenous Variables**
- **Exogenous Variable:** The price of outer-ring apartments, determined by external factors outside the model.
- **Endogenous Variable:** The price of inner-ring apartments, determined by factors within the model.

**Simplification of Apartment Characteristics**
In this example model, all inner-ring apartments are treated as identical, differing only by location. This allows a single "price" to represent the market rate without considering specific features (e.g. bedroom count).

**Purpose of this model**
This model aims to determine:
1. The price of inner-ring apartments
2. Criteria for who will occupy these apartments
3. Evaluation of different economic mechanisms for allocating apartments.

### 2. Optimisation and Equilibrium

**Framework for Analysing Human Behaviour in economics**
Economic analysis relies on two core principles:
- **Optimisation Principle:** Individuals aim to choose the best affordable options, preferring what they want over what they don't. This principle underpins consumer behaviour.
- **Equilibrium Principle:** Prices adjust until demand equals supply. While there may be temporary mismatches, markets typically reach a stable equilibrium over time, such as stable rental prices in the apartment market.

**Equilibrium in Different models**
The definition of equilibrium can vary depending on the model's complexity. In simple markets, demand-supply equilibrium suffices, but broader models may require more nuanced definitions to ensure consistency in agents' actions.

**Application of Principles**
These principles help economics answer questions about price determination, allocation, and market stability, providing a foundation for introducing economic concepts.

This framework allows economics to predict market outcomes by assuming rational choices and eventual market balance.

### 3. The Demand Curve

**Reservation Price**
Each potential renter has a maximum price they're willing to pay (**reservation price**) for an inner-ring apartment. If the market price is equal to or below this reservation price, they would rent an apartment.

[Figure 1.1]

**Demand Curve Explanation**
The demand curve [Figure 1.1] represents how many apartments will be rented at each price point.
- At the highest reservation price ($500), only one apartment is rented.
- As the price decreases to the next reservation price ($490), another apartment is rented, increasing the quantity demanded.

**Shape of the demand curve**
- The demand curve slopes downwards because more renters are willing to rent as prices decrease.
- In a larger market, with many potential renters whose reservation prices are closer together, the demand curve will appear smoother and continuous.

**Market Behaviour**
This curve helps to predict rental quantity at different price points. When the price exceeds all reservation prices, no apartments are rented. As price drops to meet individual reservation prices, demand increases accordingly.

### 4. The Supply Curve

**Competitive Market**
In a competitive market with many independent landlords, all seeking to rent at the highest price the market will bear, the equilibrium price will be the same for all inner-ring apartments.

**Equilibrium Price Consistency**
If prices vary (e.g., some apartments at a high price $p_H$ and others at a low price $p_L$), renters would seek a better deal by negotiating a rent between $p_H$ and $p_L$, pushing the market towards a single price reaching an equilibrium.

![[Pasted image 20241027121809.png]]
The above figure is the demand curve for apartments with many demanders. Because of the larger number of demanders, the jumps between prices will be small, and the demand curve will have the conventional smooth shape.

**Short Run Supply Curve**
- In the short run, the supply of apartments is fixed because it's not feasible to construct new apartments quickly.
- The supply curve represented by a vertical line, meaning the number of apartments available does not change with price in the short run. All available apartments are rented at the market price.

![[Pasted image 20241027121859.png]]

**Long-Run Supply Adjustment**
Over a longer time frame, landlords could respond to higher prices by increasing supply (e.g., building more apartments), but this flexibility doesn't apply in the short run.

The short-run supply curve's vertical shape indicates that supply is inelastic in the short run, meaning quantity supplied is fixed regardless of price.

### 5. Market Equilibrium

**Equilibrium Price $P^*$**
The equilibrium price is the point where the demand curve and the supply curve intersect, as shown in the figure below. At this price, the quantity of apartments demanded equals the quantity supplied.

![[Pasted image 20241027123303.png]]

**Behaviour at Equilibrium**
At price $p^*$, consumers willing to pay at least $p^*$ find an apartment, and landlords rent out all their apartments. Neither consumers nor landlords have an incentive to change behaviour, making this a stable equilibrium.

**Non-Equilibrium Scenarios**
- If $p < p^*$: Demand exceeds supply, leading to a shortage of apartments for renters (they want an apartment). Landlords may raise prices as renters compete for apartments.
- If $p > p^*$: Supply exceeds demand, resulting in vacancies. Landlords may lower prices to attract renters.

**Allocation of Apartments**
At $p^*$, renters who are willing to pay $p^*$ or more get inner-ring apartments, while those unwilling to pay $p^*$ reside in outer-ring apartments. Renters with a reservation price of exactly $p^*$ are indifferent between inner and outer-ring apartments, while others in the inner ring pay less than their maximum willingness to pay.

### 6. Comparative Statics

**Comparative Statics Analysis**
This type of analysis examines how the equilibrium price $p^*$ changes when different aspects of the market change. It compares two "static" equilibria without considering how the market moves between them.

**Increase in Supply**
- When the supply of apartments increases, as shown in the figure below, the equilibrium price $p^*$ falls.
- Conversely, if the supply decreases, the equilibrium price $p^*$ would rise.

![[Pasted image 20241027124748.png]]

**Effect of Creating Condominiums**
When some apartments are converted into condominiums (units), both supply and demand for apartments decrease.
- **Supply Decrease:** Fewer apartments are available for rent.
- **Demand Decrease:** Some renters choose to buy condos instead, reducing the number of renters.
If supply and demand decrease by the same amount, the equilibrium price $p^*$ remains unchanged, as seen in the figure below.

![[Pasted image 20241027125036.png]]

**Apartment Tax Impact**
Suppose the city imposes a tax of **$50** per apartment per year. While it seems logical that landlords would pass this cost onto renters, the equilibrium price $p^*$ actually remains unchanged.

The reason for this is that both the supply and demand curves remain unchanged, as the number of apartments and the quantity demanded at each price stay the same. Landlords cannot raise prices further if they were already charging the maximum the market could bear, meaning they would have to absorb the tax entirely.

This analysis shows that changes in supply or demand affect equilibrium, but a fixed supply and unshifted demand mean taxes do not alter rental prices.

### 7. Other Ways to Allocate Apartments

**Discriminating Monopolist**
- In a monopoly, one landlord controls all apartments and can set up unique prices for each renter. This setup is called **discriminating monopoly**.
- If the landlord knows each renter's reservation price, they would rent each apartment to the highest bidder, moving down the demand curve.
- The allocation is the same as in a competitive market, with renters willing to pay at least $p^*$ securing apartments, although they may pay different prices.

**Ordinary Monopolist**
- If the monopolist charges a single price $\hat{p}$, they face a trade-off: a higher price reduces rented apartments but may maximise revenue.
- **Revenue calculation:** The monopolist's revenue $pD(\hat{p})$, the area of a rectangle with the height $p$ and with $D(\hat{p})$ as shown in the figure below.
- Generally, the monopolist restricts supply to raise prices above the competitive equilibrium $p^*$, resulting in fewer rented apartments.

![[Pasted image 20241027130448.png]]

**Rent Control**
- Rent control imposes a maximum rent $p_{\text{max}}$ below the equilibrium price $p^*$.
- This creates excess demand, as more people wish to rent at $p_{\text{max}}$ than there are apartments available.
- Allocation under rent control depends on factors like search effort, connections rather than market forces. Different renters, often previously from the outer ring, may secure inner-ring apartments, displacing those who would have rented them at market price.

### 8. Which Way is Best?

**Four Methods of Allocating Apartments**
1. **Competitive Market:** Allocation based on supply and demand equilibrium.
2. **Discriminating Monopolist**: A single landlord charges different prices to maximise revenue, based on each renter's willingness to pay.
3. **Ordinary Monopolist:** A single landlord charges a single price, balancing between renting fewer apartments at a higher price and renting more at a lower price.
4. **Rent Control**: Imposes a maximum rent $p_{\text{max}}$ below the competitive equilibrium $p^*$, causing excess demand.

**Evaluating the Allocation Methods**
Apartment Owners' Perspective:
- **Discriminating Monopolist:** Maximises revenue for owners, as they can charge each renter their reservation price.
- **Rent Control:** Likely the least favourable, as it limits income by capping rents below the market rate.

Renters' Perspective:
- **Discriminating Monopolist:** Generally worse for renters, as they pay more than in other allocation methods.
- **Rent Control:** Beneficial for those who can secure an apartment at $p_{\text{max}}$, but unfavourable for those who cannot due to excess demand.

**Considering All Parties**
- To assess the desirability of each method, we need to consider the economic positions of all parties - both renters and landlords.
- A criteria is needed that evaluates the idea of "goodness" of an allocation method by considering the welfare of all involved.

### 9. Pareto Efficiency

**Definition**
An allocation is Pareto efficient if no further Pareto improvements are possible, meaning there is no way to make someone better off without making someone worse off. An allocation that allows for a Pareto improvement is considered Pareto inefficient.

**Pareto Inefficiency**
A Pareto inefficient allocation is less desirable because there's an opportunity to improve someone's situation without negatively impacting others. This indicates an unexploited potential for mutual benefit.

> [!example] Example of Pareto Efficiency in Apartment Allocation
> Suppose renters are randomly assigned to inner and outer ring apartments but allowed to sublet:
> - Renters with a higher valuation for inner-ring apartments might trade with those who value them less.
> - For instance, if person A values their inner-ring apartment at $200, and person B values it at $300, they could arrange a mutually beneficial trade with a side payment.

**Outcome of Voluntary Trade**
- If all voluntary trades are completed, the resulting allocation is Pareto efficient, because all possible gains from trade have been realised.
- This final allocation ensures that those who value inner-ring apartments the most end up with them, as shown through the principle of gains from trade.

### 10. Comparing Ways to Allocate Apartments

**Outcome of Pareto Efficiency in Apartment Allocation**
- In a Pareto efficient allocation, those with the highest reservation prices will occupy the inner-ring apartments. If there are $S$ apartments, the $S$ people with the highest reservation prices end up in those apartments.
- Any other arrangement would allow for trades that make at least two people better off without making anyone worse off.

**Applying Pareto Efficiency to Allocation Methods**
- **Competitive Markets:** This mechanism is Pareto efficient because it assigns inner-ring apartments to those who are willing to pay more than the equilibrium price $p^*$, leaving no further gains from trade.
- **Discriminating Monopolist:** This arrangement is also Pareto efficient since the landlord assigns apartments to those with the highest willingness to pay, just as in a competitive market. However, income distribution differs, with landlords benefiting more than renters.

**Ordinary Monopolist**
- Not Pareto efficient because some apartments may remain unrented at the set price. The monopolist could improve profits by renting an apartment to someone at any positive price, creating a Pareto improvement without affecting other renters.

**Rent Control**
- Rent control is also Pareto inefficient. Arbitrary apartment assignments mean that some individuals in inner-ring apartments may value them less than individuals in outer-ring apartments.

This comparison demonstrates that while both competitive markets and discriminating monopolies can achieve Pareto efficiency, ordinary monopolies and rent control generally do not, as they leave opportunities for mutually beneficial trades unfulfilled.

### 11. Equilibrium in the Long Run

**Long-Run Equilibrium**
Unlike the short run, where the supply of apartments is fixed, in the long run, the supply can vary based on market conditions.

**Supply Behaviour**
- The supply of new apartments depends on profitability for landlords, which is influenced by the price they can charge.
- In a variable supply situation, both supply and demand curves interact to determine the final market price.

**Key Long-Run Questions**
With variable supply, we can examine questions such as:
1. Will a monopolist supply more or fewer apartments than a competitive market?
2. How does rent control affect the equilibrium number of apartments?
3. Which market institutions lead to a Pareto efficient number of apartments?
