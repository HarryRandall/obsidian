## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Pareto Efficiency | Allocation where no one can be made better off without making someone worse off |
| Contract Curve | Set of all Pareto efficient allocations |
| Market Equilibrium | Prices where demand equals supply for all goods |
| Walras' Law | Value of aggregate excess demand always zero |
| First Welfare Theorem | Every competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient |
| Second Welfare Theorem | With convex preferences, any Pareto efficient allocation can be market equilibrium |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] Is it possible to have a Pareto efficient allocation where someone is worse off than he is at an allocation that is not Pareto efficient?
- [ ] Is it possible to have a Pareto efficient allocation where everyone is worse off than they are at an allocation that is not Pareto efficient?
- [ ] True or false? If we know the contract curve, then we know the outcome of any trading.
- [ ] Can some individual be made better off if we are at a Pareto efficient allocation?
- [ ] If the value of excess demand in 8 out of 10 markets is equal to zero, what must be true about the remaining two markets?
