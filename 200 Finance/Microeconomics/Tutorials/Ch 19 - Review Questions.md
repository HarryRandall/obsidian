## Overview

Review questions covering production functions, returns to scale, technical rate of substitution, marginal product, and production technology.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Returns to Scale

Understanding constant, increasing, and decreasing returns to scale.

### 2. Technical Rate of Substitution

Understanding how inputs can be substituted in production.

### 3. Marginal Product

Understanding the law of diminishing marginal product.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Production Function | $f(x_1, x_2)$ - output as function of inputs |
| Constant Returns to Scale | $f(tx_1, tx_2) = tf(x_1, x_2)$ |
| Increasing Returns to Scale | $f(tx_1, tx_2) > tf(x_1, x_2)$ |
| Decreasing Returns to Scale | $f(tx_1, tx_2) < tf(x_1, x_2)$ |
| Technical Rate of Substitution | Rate at which one input can be substituted for another |
| Marginal Product | Additional output from one more unit of input |
| Diminishing Marginal Product | Marginal product decreases as input increases |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] Consider the production function $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2$. Does this exhibit constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to scale?
- [ ] Consider the production function $f(x_1, x_2) = 4x_1^{\frac{1}{2}} x_2^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Does this exhibit constant, increasing, or decreasing returns to scale?
- [ ] The Cobb-Douglas production function is given by $f(x_1, x_2) = A x_1^a x_2^b$. It turns out that the type of returns to scale of this function will depend on the magnitude of $a + b$. Which values of $a + b$ will be associated with the different kinds of returns to scale?
- [ ] The technical rate of substitution between factors $x_2$ and $x_1$ is $-4$. If you desire to produce the same amount of output but cut your use of $x_1$ by 3 units, how many more units of $x_2$ will you need?
- [ ] True or false? If the law of diminishing marginal product did not hold, the world's food supply could be grown in a flowerpot.
- [ ] In a production process is it possible to have decreasing marginal product in an input and yet increasing returns to scale?
