## Overview

Review questions covering budget constraints, changes in prices and income, budget line properties, numeraire goods, taxes and subsidies, and consumer welfare.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Budget Line Changes

Understanding how changes in prices and income affect the budget constraint.

### 2. Budget Line Properties

Analyzing the slope and intercepts of budget lines.

### 3. Taxes and Subsidies

Understanding how taxes and subsidies affect the budget constraint.

### 4. Consumer Welfare

Analyzing how changes in prices and income affect consumer well-being.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Budget Constraint | $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 \le m$ - combinations of goods consumer can afford |
| Budget Line | $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$ - combinations that cost exactly $m$ |
| Slope of Budget Line | $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ - opportunity cost of good 1 in terms of good 2 |
| Numeraire | Reference price set to 1 to simplify analysis |
| Quantity Tax | Fixed tax $t$ per unit, effective price becomes $p_1 + t$ |
| Quantity Subsidy | Fixed subsidy $s$ per unit, effective price becomes $p_1 - s$ |
| Lump-Sum Tax | Fixed tax regardless of consumption, shifts budget line inward |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] Originally the consumer faces the budget line $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$. Then the price of good 1 doubles, the price of good 2 becomes 8 times larger, and income becomes 4 times larger. Write down an equation for the new budget line in terms of the original prices and income.
- [ ] What happens to the budget line if the price of good 2 increases, but the price of good 1 and income remain constant?
- [ ] If the price of good 1 doubles and the price of good 2 triples, does the budget line become flatter or steeper?
- [ ] What is the definition of a numeraire good?
- [ ] Suppose that the government puts a tax of 15 cents a gallon on gasoline and then later decides to put a subsidy on gasoline at a rate of 7 cents a gallon. What net tax is this combination equivalent to?
- [ ] Suppose that a budget equation is given by $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$. The government decides to impose a lump-sum tax of $u$, a quantity tax on good 1 of $t$, and a quantity subsidy on good 2 of $s$. What is the formula for the new budget line?
- [ ] If the income of the consumer increases and one of the prices decreases at the same time, will the consumer necessarily be at least as well-off?
