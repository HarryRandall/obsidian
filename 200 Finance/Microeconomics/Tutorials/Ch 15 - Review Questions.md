## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Market Demand | Sum of individual demands: $D(p) = \sum x_i(p)$ |
| Inverse Demand Curve | Price as function of quantity: $p(q)$ |
| Price Elasticity | Percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in price |
| Revenue | $R = p \cdot q$ |
| Marginal Revenue | Additional revenue from selling one more unit |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] If the market demand curve is $D(p) = 100 - 0.5p$, what is the inverse demand curve? 
- [ ] An addict's demand function for a drug may be very inelastic, but the market demand function might be quite elastic. How can this be? 
- [ ] If $D(p) = 12 - 2p$, what price will maximise revenue? 
- [ ] Suppose that the demand curve for a good is given by $D(p) = \frac{100}{p}$. What price will maximise revenue? 
- [ ] True or false? In a two-good model, if one good is an inferior good, the other good must be a luxury good.
