## Overview

Review questions covering utility functions, monotonic transformations, constructing utility functions, different types of utility functions (perfect substitutes, perfect complements, quasilinear, Cobb-Douglas), and marginal utility.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Monotonic Transformations

Understanding what constitutes a monotonic transformation and how it preserves preferences.

### 2. Utility Functions

Understanding how to construct utility functions from preferences and identify different types.

### 3. Marginal Utility

Understanding how marginal utility relates to preferences and choice.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Utility | Way to represent consumer preferences, ranking bundles |
| Ordinal Utility | Only order matters, not magnitude of differences |
| Monotonic Transformation | Function that preserves preference order |
| Utility Function | Function that assigns numbers to bundles representing preferences |
| Perfect Substitutes Utility | $u(x_1, x_2) = a x_1 + b x_2$ |
| Perfect Complements Utility | $u(x_1, x_2) = \min \{a x_1, b x_2\}$ |
| Quasilinear Utility | $u(x_1, x_2) = v(x_1) + x_2$ - linear in $x_2$, nonlinear in $x_1$ |
| Cobb-Douglas Utility | $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1^c x_2^d$ |
| Marginal Utility (MU) | Rate of change in utility from small increase in one good |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] The text said that raising a number to an odd power was a monotonic transformation. What about raising a number to an even power? Is this a monotonic transformation? (Hint: consider the case $f(u) = u^2$.)
- [ ] Which of the following are monotonic transformations?
  - (1) $u = 2v - 13$ 
  - (2) $u = -\frac{1}{v^2}$
  - (3) $u = \frac{1}{v^2}$
  - (4) $u = \ln v$
  - (5) $u = -e^{-v}$
  - (6) $u = v^2$
  - (7) $u = v^2$ for $v > 0$
  - (8) $u = v^2$ for $v < 0$
- [ ] We claimed in the text that if preferences were monotonic, then a diagonal line through the origin would intersect each indifference curve exactly once. Can you prove this rigorously? (Hint: what would happen if it intersected some indifference curve twice?)
- [ ] What kind of preferences are represented by a utility function of the form $u(x_1, x_2) = \sqrt{x_1} + x_2$? What about the utility function $v(x_1, x_2) = 13x_1 + 13x_2$?
- [ ] What kind of preferences are represented by a utility function of the form $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + \sqrt{x_2}$? Is the utility function $v(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + 2x_1 \sqrt{x_2} + x_2$ a monotonic transformation of $u(x_1, x_2)$?
- [ ] Consider the utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = \sqrt{x_1x_2}$. What kind of preferences does it represent? Is the function $v(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2$ a monotonic transformation of $u(x_1, x_2)$? Is the function $w(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 x_2^2$ a monotonic transformation of $u(x_1, x_2)$?
- [ ] Can you explain why taking a monotonic transformation of a utility function doesn't change the marginal rate of substitution?
