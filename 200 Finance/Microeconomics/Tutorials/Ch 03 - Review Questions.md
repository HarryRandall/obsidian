## Overview

Review questions covering consumer preferences, preference axioms, indifference curves, different types of preferences (perfect substitutes, perfect complements, bads, neutral goods), convexity, and marginal rate of substitution.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Preference Axioms

Understanding completeness, reflexivity, and transitivity of preferences.

### 2. Indifference Curves

Analyzing properties of indifference curves and when they can cross.

### 3. Types of Preferences

Understanding perfect substitutes, perfect complements, bads, neutral goods, and convex preferences.

### 4. Marginal Rate of Substitution

Understanding MRS and its relationship to preferences.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Strict Preference | $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$ - consumer prefers first bundle |
| Indifference | $(x_1, x_2) \sim (y_1, y_2)$ - consumer equally satisfied with either bundle |
| Weak Preference | $(x_1, x_2) \succeq (y_1, y_2)$ - consumer finds first bundle at least as good |
| Completeness Axiom | Any two bundles can be compared |
| Reflexivity Axiom | Any bundle is at least as good as itself |
| Transitivity Axiom | If $A \succeq B$ and $B \succeq C$, then $A \succeq C$ |
| Indifference Curve | Boundary of weakly preferred set - bundles equally desirable |
| Perfect Substitutes | Goods that can be exchanged at constant rate |
| Perfect Complements | Goods consumed together in fixed proportions |
| Bad | Commodity consumer dislikes |
| Neutral Good | Commodity that doesn't affect satisfaction |
| Convex Preferences | Balance preferred to extremes |
| Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) | Slope of indifference curve - rate willing to trade one good for another |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] If we observe a consumer choosing $(x_1, x_2)$ when $(y_1, y_2)$ is available one time, are we justified in concluding that $(x_1, x_2) \succ (y_1, y_2)$?
- [ ] Consider a group of people $A$, $B$, $C$ and the relation "at least as tall as," as in "$A$ is at least as tall as $B$." Is this relation transitive? Is it complete?
- [ ] Take the same group of people and consider the relation "strictly taller than." Is this relation transitive? Is it reflexive? Is it complete?
- [ ] A college football coach says that given any two linemen $A$ and $B$, he always prefers the one who is bigger and faster. Is this preference relation transitive? Is it complete?
- [ ] Can an indifference curve cross itself? For example, could Figure 3.2 depict a single indifference curve?
- [ ] Could Figure 3.2 be a single indifference curve if preferences are monotonic?
- [ ] If both pepperoni and anchovies are bads, will the indifference curve have a positive or a negative slope?
- [ ] Explain why convex preferences mean that "averages are preferred to extremes."
- [ ] What is your marginal rate of substitution of \$1 bills for \$5 bills?
- [ ] If good 1 is a "neutral," what is its marginal rate of substitution for good 2?
- [ ] Think of some other goods for which your preferences might be concave.
