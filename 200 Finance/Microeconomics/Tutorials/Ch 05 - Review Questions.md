## Overview

Review questions covering consumer choice, optimal bundles, demand functions for different preference types, and the relationship between preferences and demand.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Optimal Choice

Understanding how consumers choose optimal bundles given budget constraints and preferences.

### 2. Demand Functions

Deriving demand functions for different types of preferences.

### 3. Special Cases

Understanding corner solutions and boundary optima.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Optimal Choice | Bundle that maximizes utility subject to budget constraint |
| Tangency Condition | At optimum, MRS equals price ratio: $MRS = -\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ |
| Demand Function | Function showing optimal quantity as function of prices and income |
| Corner Solution | Optimal choice where one good is not consumed |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] If two goods are perfect substitutes, what is the demand function for good 2?
- [ ] Suppose that indifference curves are described by straight lines with a slope of $-b$. Given arbitrary prices and money income $p_1$, $p_2$, and $m$, what will the consumer's optimal choices look like?
- [ ] Suppose that a consumer always consumes 2 spoons of sugar with each cup of coffee. If the price of sugar is $p_1$ per spoonful and the price of coffee is $p_2$ per cup, and the consumer has $m$ dollars to spend on coffee and sugar, how much will they want to purchase?
- [ ] Suppose that you have highly nonconvex preferences for ice cream and olives, like those given in the text, and that you face prices $p_1$, $p_2$, and have $m$ dollars to spend. List the choices for the optimal consumption bundles.
- [ ] If a consumer has a utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 x_2^4$, what fraction of her income will she spend on good 2?
- [ ] For what kind of preferences will the consumer be just as well-off facing a quantity tax as an income tax?
