## Overview

Review questions covering market equilibrium, taxes and subsidies, tax incidence, deadweight loss, and the effects of taxes on different market structures.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Tax Incidence

Understanding who bears the burden of taxes in different market conditions.

### 2. Deadweight Loss

Understanding the efficiency costs of taxation.

### 3. Market Structure Effects

Understanding how taxes affect markets with different supply and demand elasticities.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Tax Incidence | Distribution of tax burden between buyers and sellers |
| Deadweight Loss | Efficiency loss from taxation |
| Subsidy | Payment from government to producers or consumers |
| Vertical Supply Curve | Perfectly inelastic supply |
| Horizontal Supply Curve | Perfectly elastic supply |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] What is the effect of a subsidy in a market with a horizontal supply curve? With a vertical supply curve?
- [ ] Suppose that the demand curve is vertical while the supply curve slopes upward. If a tax is imposed in this market, who ends up paying it?
- [ ] Suppose that all consumers view red pencils and blue pencils as perfect substitutes. Suppose that the supply curve for red pencils is upward sloping. Let the price of red pencils and blue pencils be $p_r$ and $p_b$. What would happen if the government put a tax only on red pencils?
- [ ] The United States imports about half of its petroleum needs. Suppose that the rest of the oil producers are willing to supply as much oil as the United States wants at a constant price of \$25 a barrel. What would happen to the price of domestic oil if a tax of \$5 a barrel were placed on foreign oil?
- [ ] Suppose that the supply curve is vertical. What is the deadweight loss of a tax in this market?
- [ ] Consider the tax treatment of borrowing and lending described in the text. How much revenue does this tax system raise if borrowers and lenders are in the same tax bracket?
- [ ] Does such a tax system raise a positive or negative amount of revenue when $t_l < t_b$?
