## Overview

Review questions covering demand functions, income and substitution effects, normal and inferior goods, complements and substitutes, inverse demand functions, and homothetic preferences.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Demand Functions

Understanding how demand responds to changes in prices and income.

### 2. Income and Substitution Effects

Analyzing how price changes affect demand through income and substitution effects.

### 3. Types of Goods

Understanding normal goods, inferior goods, complements, and substitutes.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Demand Function | $x_1(p_1, p_2, m)$ - quantity demanded as function of prices and income |
| Normal Good | Good for which demand increases with income |
| Inferior Good | Good for which demand decreases with income |
| Complements | Goods consumed together - increase in price of one decreases demand for other |
| Substitutes | Goods that can replace each other - increase in price of one increases demand for other |
| Homothetic Preferences | Preferences where MRS depends only on ratio of goods, not absolute quantities |
| Inverse Demand Function | Price as function of quantity demanded |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] If the consumer is consuming exactly two goods, and she is always spending all of her money, can both of them be inferior goods?
- [ ] Show that perfect substitutes are an example of homothetic preferences.
- [ ] Show that Cobb-Douglas preferences are homothetic preferences.
- [ ] The income offer curve is to the Engel curve as the price offer curve is to . . .?
- [ ] If the preferences are concave, will the consumer ever consume both of the goods together?
- [ ] Are hamburgers and buns complements or substitutes?
- [ ] What is the form of the inverse demand function for good 1 in the case of perfect complements?
- [ ] True or false? If the demand function is $x_1 = -p_1$, then the inverse demand function is $x = -\frac{1}{p_1}$
