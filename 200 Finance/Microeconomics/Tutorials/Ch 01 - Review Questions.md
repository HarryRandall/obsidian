## Overview

Review questions covering economic models, demand curves, equilibrium prices, market demand, comparative statics, taxes, monopoly pricing, and Pareto efficiency.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Demand Curves and Reservation Prices

Understanding how reservation prices determine the shape of demand curves and how equilibrium prices are determined.

### 2. Market Equilibrium

Analyzing how equilibrium prices change with supply and demand conditions.

### 3. Comparative Statics

Examining how changes in market conditions affect equilibrium outcomes.

### 4. Monopoly and Market Power

Understanding how monopolists set prices differently from competitive markets.

### 5. Pareto Efficiency

Analyzing whether different allocation mechanisms achieve Pareto efficiency.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Reservation Price | Maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a good |
| Demand Curve | Relationship between price and quantity demanded |
| Equilibrium Price | Price where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied |
| Pareto Efficiency | Allocation where no one can be made better off without making someone worse off |

## Questions & Discussion

- [ ] Suppose that there were 25 people who had a reservation price of \$500, and the 26th person had a reservation price of \$200. What would the demand curve look like?
- [ ] In the above example, what would the equilibrium price be if there were 24 apartments to rent? What if there were 26 apartments to rent? What if there were 25 apartments to rent?
- [ ] If people have different reservation prices, why does the market demand curve slope down?
- [ ] In the text, we assumed that the condominium purchasers came from the inner-ring people—people who were already renting apartments. What would happen to the price of inner-ring apartments if all the condominium purchasers were outer-ring people—the people who were not currently renting apartments in the inner ring?
- [ ] Suppose now that the condominium purchasers were all inner-ring people, but that each condominium was constructed from two apartments. What would happen to the price of apartments?
- [ ] What do you suppose the effect of a tax would be on the number of apartments that would be built in the long run?
- [ ] Suppose the demand curve is $D(p) = 100 - 2p$. What price would the monopolist set if he had 60 apartments? How many would he rent? What price would he set if he had 40 apartments? How many would he rent?
- [ ] If our model of rent control allowed for unrestricted subletting, who would end up getting apartments in the inner circle? Would the outcome be Pareto efficient?
