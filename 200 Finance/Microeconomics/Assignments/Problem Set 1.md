# ECON2101 S2, 2024 - Problem Set 1

## Question 1

In County Omega, there are 10 couples in the market for two-bedroom apartments — hereafter, "apartments":
- Annie and Angus
- Barry and Boris
- Celia and Chandra
- Delilah and Daisy
- Emanuelle and Ellis
- Fatima and Frida
- George and Gok
- Harriet and Hussein
- Isla and Ian
- Janet and Jose

For the purposes of this question, consider each couple to behave as a single economic decision-maker with its own preferences. The reservation prices for apartments of the couples are summarized in the table below. County Omega fits the model used in Chapter 1 of Varian: reservation prices are for inner ring apartments, and less desirable outer ring apartments can be bought at an exogenous price. However, if a landlord who sells to the marginal buyer offers a buyer their reservation price (and faces no competition in the form of inner ring apartments at lower prices), they will always be able to sell, even if the buyer is then indifferent between inner and outer apartments.| Couple 

| Reservation price ($) |        |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| Harriet, Hussein      | 10,000 |
| Janet, Jose           | 9,300  |
| Annie, Angus          | 9,000  |
| Fatima, Frida         | 8,000  |
| George, Gok           | 7,900  |
| Celia, Chandra        | 7,500  |
| Emanuelle, Ellis      | 6,400  |
| Isla, Ian             | 6,200  |
| Delilah, Daisy        | 4,300  |
| Barry, Boris          | 4,000  |

### (a) 
Make a graph showing market demand for apartments in County Omega.

### (b) 
If, in the short-run, only six apartments are available, what will be the equilibrium price in the market for apartments in County Omega? Which couples will rent apartments in County Omega? Suppose that flexible work arrangements lead more businesses to sell offices, which are converted into two new apartments in County Omega. Which couples will obtain apartments then? Answer with reference to your graph.

## Question 2

Suppose there are initially 6 apartments but that one of the couples inherits a house which they much prefer to an apartment.

### (a)
1. If we do not know which couple inherited the house, what are the possible equilibrium prices in the market for apartments in County Omega?
2. How is the price affected when different couples inherit, and why?

### (b)
Now, suppose that the number of couples looking for apartments in County Omega doubles (in this scenario, no one is inheriting a house). For each previous couple, there is now a couple with a reservation price $100 below theirs. Suppose that the supply of apartments is 11. Graph the new market demand in County Omega.

### (c)
Now, suppose again, under the assumptions of (b), that one couple inherits a house. Using your diagram for reference, explain whether or not it is possible for the new equilibrium price to be different from that found in part (b).

## Question 3

In this question, we consider a market consisting of the 10 consumers from Question 1. Suppose that all $n \leq 10$ apartments in County Omega are in the same building, rented by the same conglomerate at no marginal cost.

### (a)
Assume that the conglomerate must sell all apartments at the same price. For each possible value of $n$, find the maximum price the conglomerate could set to sell that many apartments in County Omega, and how much revenue it makes.

### (b)
1. If there are 6 apartments in the building, what quantity and price would the conglomerate choose?
2. Which couples would rent apartments?
3. How and why does this differ or stay the same as your answer to Question 1(b)?

### (c)
If every apartment can be sold at a different price, with 6 available, find the price and quantity sold, and the couples that obtain apartments. Compare this to the competitive equilibrium of Question 1(b) and to part (b) of this question.
