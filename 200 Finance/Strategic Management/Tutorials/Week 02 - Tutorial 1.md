---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Under Armour Case Study

- A time of change and turbulence.
- Change of CEO:
  - KP founder 2006-2017
  - Patrick Frisk 2017-2019
  - Colin Browne 2019-2022
  - Stephanie Linnartz 2023-current
    - New perspective of the industry experience
    - First external CEO hire

### 2. A Company's Competitiveness

- Six questions to consider in evaluating a company's ability to compete against market rivals
- Question 1: How well is the present strategy working? Use different indicators to evaluate it.

### 3. SWOT

- A good strategy aims at capturing a company's most attractive opportunities and at defending against threats to its well being.
- Question 2: What is the company's overall situation (internal strengths and weaknesses in relation to its market opportunities and external threats)?

### 4. Business Model Canvas & Value-Price-Cost Framework

- Support your understanding of a company's current business, including VP, CS, CR, Channels, R$, KP, KA, KR, CS. How much value CS are getting for money? How efficiently can we meet CS wants and needs to deliver on VPs?

### 5. Parallel Approaches for Developing Strategy

- A company needs both deliberate (planned initiatives to improve its $ performance and secure a competitive edge) and emergent strategy (develop on the fly, respond to unexpected events, changes, and unanticipated happenings).

### 6. Is it a Winning Strategy?

- (1). The Fit test: internal, external and dynamic.
- (2). The competitive advantage test: competitive advantage over rivals
- (3). The performance test: market standing and profitability.

### 7. The Five-Stage Process Model

- Internal and external factors in deciding upon a strategic direction, objectives, and approaches to crafting and executing a strategy.

### 8. The Fitness Test

- T1: The fitness test: how well does the strategy fit with company's situation

| External | Internal | Dynamic |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
|          |          |         |

- Clear(er) values, vision, objectives
  - Not a winning strategy
- Restructuring programs (former CEOs, without a clear direction) were unable to improve AU's performance expected.
- Increase cost, customer needs not clear, product weaknesses, niche markets, didn't fully use its strengths
- Emergent strategy was not crafted and executed.

### 9. Competitive Advantage of Under Armour

- Product innovation, too little too late.
- Marketing, too generic

**Strengths**
- Innovative products with IPs (hot-cold-All season gear); product development team with experience at leading fabric throughout world.
- Direct to customer sales: outlet e-commerce, storytelling skills about its products.
- Operating in four geographic regions: Signing high-profile sports figures: football, basketball etc.

**Compare**
- Nike: develop products based on changes in life style, calorie-burning and wellness.
- Adidas: materials for all types of weather conditions; use plastic waste to make shoes;
- Fabrics + Fashion
- Nike: NikePlus app benefits (discount + free shipping & return etc)
- Nike: worldwide distribution network.
- Adidas: #2 in the US; Asia-pacific sales increasing.

### 10. Is it a Winning Strategy?

Is the strategy producing superior company performance?
- Inventory management: $1.1 billion ending inventory.
  - Poor sell performance
- Management teams were confident about seizing the opportunities
  - Build greater international awareness of its brand and grow its sales
  - Open more factory outlet stores
- Outsourcing
  - UA has no long-term agreements with the manufactures.
