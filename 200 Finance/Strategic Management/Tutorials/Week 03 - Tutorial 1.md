## Overview

Tutorial covering assignment feedback and case study analysis tips.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. First Assignment Feedback

- Form building blocks
- Like reading the news (don't do this)
  - Be factual
  - E.G., 70% for revenue
- Analysis, make sense of the facts
  - E.G., 70% for revenue, is way too high
  - Why is it important, because it's too high, there's an over-reliance on market.
- What do we do about it
  - Changes that can be made.
- Tip for case study
  - Briefly introduce the frameworks
  - Weird to go straight into strategic implications
  - Don't waffle on irrelevant things

### 2. Case Study Example - Lululemon

- Lululemon, revamp mirror software.
  - This is ok
  - Making it relevant and tangible
  - Tell lululemon what to do
  - Ditch the Mirror software altogether
  - Threat/opportunity to arise
    - Launch a whole new software
    - In Mandarin
    - In China
  - Different
- Not just
  - Move away from American Markets
  - State how they should move away
  - Sell products
  - More marketing in China etc
- Don't go into too much detail
- Give enough detail though
