## Overview

Sources of competitive advantage covering broad low-cost strategies, low-cost strategies, and their applications and cautions.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Sources of Competitive Advantage

### 2. Broad Low-Cost Strategies

1. Available when the organisation is able to perform value-chain activities more cost effectively than rivals.
2. Or when the organisation has a business model and or value chain where cost-producing activities are minimised/eliminated/outsourced to lower cost providers.
- Typically cost-drivers and opportunities to minimise costs are found in Porter's include:
  - Economies of scale
  - Learning and experience
  - Capacity utilisation
  - Supply chain efficiency
  - Input costs
  - Production technologies and design
  - Communication systems and information technology
  - Bargaining power outsourcing or vertical integration
  - Incentive systems and culture.

### 3. Low-Cost Strategies

- Works best when
  - Price competition is fierce
  - Products and value propositions are commoditised (in the minds of customers) and readily available.
  - Buyers use the products in the same way (allowing scale)
  - Switching costs for buyers are low
- Cautions
  - Higher volumes don't necessarily translate to higher profits
  - Low price-based strategies are easy to copy
  - You can destroy customer value.
