## Key Concepts

### 1. Why Strategy Matters

- In business, strategy is king. Leadership and hard work are all very well and luck is very useful, but it's strategy that makes or breaks a firm.
- Luck is useful and explains why some companies are blessed with initial, short-lived success.
- Only well-crafted, well-executed, constantly evolving strategy can explain why an elite set of companies somehow manage to rise to the top and stay there, year after year.

### 2. Fighting the Gravity of Average Performance

Practices of consistent top performers:
- **Reset mental models**
  - The first challenge is a mental one - avoiding the mindsets of complacency and inevitability.
- **Adopt new business metrics**
  - Although past performance is far less likely to persist into the future, the most commonly used metrics in business (i.e., growth, market share, and profitability) only indicate what has happened in the past. This is helpful but in order to grow, you need to utilise forward-looking metrics such as the "freshness" of its revenue mix (the share of sales from offerings based on recent innovations) or its capacity to reinvent the business and grow substantially.
- **Embrace a multi-dimensional approach to strategy**
  - Because the key to success is ever-changing, companies must be managed on multiple timescales simultaneously; running the company in the short term by exploiting existing niches and optimising operations, and in the long term by exploiting possibilities and developing a pipeline of future bets. These challenges require fundamentally different skills and approaches, but organisations can be structured to accomplish both.
- **Reinvent organisational capabilities**
  - As the business environment evolves more rapidly, companies can no longer rely on static capabilities like efficiency and quality. They should instead experiment and try to grow at scale.

### 3. Definition of Strategy

The coordinated set of the following actions:
- How to position the company in the marketplace
- How to attract customers [or clients or target stakeholders]
- How to compete against rivals
- How to achieve the company's performance targets.
- How to capitalise on opportunities to grow the business
- How to respond to changing economic and market conditions

Strategy, at its essence, is about competing differently - doing what rival firms don't do or what rival firms can't do.

Knowing what not to do, can be as important as knowing what to do, strategically.

### 4. Impacting the Business Model

At the core of every strategy is the company's business model. A business model is management's blueprint for delivering a valuable product or service to customers in a manner that will generate revenue. The two values of a company's business model are:
- **Customer value proposition** (lays out the company's approach to satisfying buyer wants and needs at a price the customers will consider good value).
- **Profit formula** (the company's approach to determining a cost structure that will allow for acceptable profits, given the pricing tied to its customer value proposition)

### 5. Strategic Management Definition

- Competitive advantage is at the heart of a firm's performance in competitive markets.
- Strategy is about making specific choices to win in the marketplace

### 6. Shared Value

- The solution lies in the principle of shared value, which involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges.

### 7. Strategic Managers Must

1. Understand and evaluate the internal and external forces that may impact upon the organisation
2. Clearly identify those issues critical to the organisations current and future success
3. Consider and develop ways to address the strategic challengers or issues facing the organisation
4. Define the preferred path to fulfilling objectives
5. Monitor and adapt the strategy as events unfold.

### 8. Key Questions

1. Where are we now? (analyse the current strategic position and likely future scenarios).
2. Where are we going? (develop a plausible and sustainable desired future for the organisation - goals and objectives)
3. How will we get there? (develop strategies and action programs to get there)
4. How will we know we are on track? (implement measuring and monitoring systems)

### 9. Strategic Thinking Vs Strategic Planning

Strategy is thinking of an organisation as a dynamic, changing entity, in terms of the allocation of its resources and its position relative to its competition.
- **Strategic thinking** is the necessary analytical and creative processes that underpin the intended and emergent initiatives (doing the right things).
- **Strategic planning** is a process designed to give form to the strategic thinking (doing things right)

### 10. Strategic Management Process

1. Developing a strategic vision, mission, and core values
2. Setting objectives
3. Crafting a strategy to achieve the objectives and the company vision
4. Executing the strategy
5. Monitoring developments, evaluation performance, and initiating corrective adjustments

### 11. Winning Strategy

1. **The Fitness Test** - how well does the strategy fit with the company's situation
2. **The Competitive Advantage Test** - Is the strategy helping the company to achieve a competitive advantage? Is the competitive advantage likely to be sustainable?
3. **The Performance Test** - Is the strategy producing superior company performance?
