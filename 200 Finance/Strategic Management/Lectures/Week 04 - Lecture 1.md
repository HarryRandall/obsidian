## Overview

Roadmaps, strategy analyses and insights, generic forms of competitive advantage, internal capabilities, sources of advantage, building blocks of competitive advantage, analysing internal capabilities, McKinsey's 7S Framework, and sustaining competitive advantage.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Roadmaps

1. A reasoned assessment of Firm Resources and Capabilities (e.g., VRIO, Strengths, and Weaknesses).
2. A reasoned assessment of Competitive Environment (e.g., Forces, Complements, potential partnerships, market maturity, PEST, Opportunities, Threats).
3. A reasoned assessment of Value Proposition (what customers, what needs, what relative pricing).
4. Careful risk assessment, including of country risk where relevant.

### 2. The Strategy Analyses and Insights

- Identifying Opportunities and Threats and Managing Risk.
- Matching organisational capabilities and external insights (VRIO framework).
- Strategic positioning
- Building strategic agility and resilience.

### 3. Generic Forms of Competitive Advantage

- **Focus low-cost strategy**
  - Aldi, Costco etc
- **Focused differentiation strategy**
  - Ferrari, Bugatti
  - High quality product at a reasonable price.
- **Broad differentiation strategy**
  - Apple, three range product (iPhone 16, 16 max, 16e)
  - Wider audience, differentiate products to some degree.
- **Broad low-cost strategy**
  - Coles sales, 2 for 1 etc.

### 4. Internal Capabilities - What Types Matter Most?

### 5. The Source of Advantage

1. Responsiveness to change
2. Innovation and creativity
3. Superior access to information or greater ability to interpret information
4. Lower costs
5. Superior access to, or superior management of, complex combinations of resources and capabilities.
6. Superior access or management of value-adding networks or relationships.

### 6. Other Building Blocks of Competitive Advantage

1. **Efficiency** - using fewer inputs to produce a particular level of output
2. **Quality** - offering products or experiences that are perceived by customers (or key stakeholders) as superior.
3. **Innovation** - generating a continuing stream of new and more valuable business models, products and processes that lead to differentiation or cost leadership.
4. **Customer (or Client) Responsiveness** - better identifying and meeting the needs of customers or key stakeholders.

### 7. Analysing Internal Capabilities

1. How well is the company's present strategy working? *(Indicators are trends in: sales/earnings growth; stock price; overall financial strength; customer acquisition and retention; critical internal process improvements)*
2. What are the company's strengths and weaknesses in relation to the market opportunities and external threats?
3. What are the company's most important resources and capabilities, and will they give the company a lasting competitive advantage over rival companies?
4. How do the company's value chain activities impact its costs structure and company value proposition?
5. Is the company competitively stronger or weaker than key rivals?
6. What strategic issues and problems merit front-burner management attention?

### 8. McKinsey's 7S Framework

Generic building blocks of competitive advantage:
1. **Shared values** - the common values and beliefs the employees share; things beyond profit.
2. **Structure** - the way the organisation defines and administers internal power and relationships, including its policies and procedures.
3. **Systems** - the decision-making systems, including both IT-based and human-based systems.
4. **Style** - the organisational culture and leadership style that typifies the organisation.
5. **Staff** - having sufficient numbers of the right people, trained, motivated and committed to the organisation's success.
6. **Skills** - the presence (or absence) of key strategic competencies needed to make strategy succeed.
7. **Strategy** - the company's integrated vision and direction.

### 9. Sustaining a Competitive Advantage

1. **Durability** - how long will the advantage from the strength endure? How can this be refined and protected?
2. **Transferability** - can the strength be made hard/difficult for a competitor to acquire (i.e. they can't simply buy it) and can the strength be transferred through other parts of the organisation?
3. **Replicability** - is the capability difficult/hard to reproduce or copy? Is it based on complex and hard-to-imitate organisational routines, processes and practices that are proprietary and unique?
