## Overview

Influential observations and outliers in regression models, covering leverage, influence, and diagnostic tools.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Leverage and Influence

- A data point has high leverage if it has "extreme" predictor X values.
- A data point is influential if it largely influences the fitting of regression models.
- High Y outliers will pull the slope drastically.
- Try the different graphs ("which = x"), and what they represent.

> [!example] Teluca Company Dataset Example
> - With an extreme outlier, the slope changes from 2.05 -> 1.95, so a ~5% change.
> - Once you see an outlier, determine if it's a one-off case, or is it part of a deeper problem that's yet to be modelled.
>   - Missing predictor value
>   - Sampling issue

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Leverage | High leverage if data point has "extreme" predictor X values |
| Influence | Data point is influential if it largely influences regression model fitting |
| Outlier | Data point that deviates significantly from other observations |
| High Y Outlier | Outlier in response variable that can pull the slope drastically |
