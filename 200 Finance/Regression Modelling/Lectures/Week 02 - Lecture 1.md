## Overview

Simple Linear Regression (SLR) covering model structure and basic concepts.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Model Structure of SLR

Only one covariate in the model.

Linear:
- $y = mx + b$
- $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i$

Where:
- $y_i$ is the Dependent Variable.
- $x_i$ is the independent variable.
- $\varepsilon_i$ relates to all values that are classed as **Unexplained**.
- $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ are coefficients, a linear relationship.
