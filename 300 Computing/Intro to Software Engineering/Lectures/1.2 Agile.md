## Overview

Introduction to Agile development methodologies, focusing on Scrum framework, user stories, sprints, and agile practices including test automation and continuous integration.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Agile Development

- Agile works by allowing you to make changes to a project quickly. There are lots of methods, there is no best method.
- Before Agile, you had Plan-Driven development that would exist for systems that would be around for a long time.
  - E.G., Westpac, running using some old Software in Melbourne.
  - E.G., some NZ company developing banking software, grew fast, transactions didn't go through on debit cards.
  - This is why people switched to Agile methods.
- **Agile Manifesto:** Finds better ways of developing software in the 90's
- Agile worked based all of there ideas around incremental development
  - Small steps, easy to change
  - A focus on features
  - Important features are prioritised and done first
  - There is a feedback loop for what to do

### 2. Process Decisions

- Estimating Effort - How long is going to take to write a software product for project planning.
- Process Decisions
  - Tracking Bugs
  - Version Control (Git)
  - Write down requirements for a project
  - Testing
  - Status meetings
- Milestones
  - For tracking progress
  - It's common to take longer for tasks

### 3. Scrum

- **Product Backlog (features)**
  - Product: The software product being developed by your team
  - Product Owner: A team member who is responsible for identifying product features. They review work done and help to test the product.
- **Product Backlog**
  - A to-do list of items such as bugs, features and product improvements that the Scum team have not yet completed.
  - Product Backlog Items (PBIS)
    - Work In Progress
    - Awaiting
    - Done
- 2-4 weeks to implement a feature from backlog
  - 24 hour daily scum meetings
  - Development team: A small self-organising team of 5-8 people who are responsible for developing the product.
- Potentially shippable product

### 4. Scrum Terminology

- Sprint: A short period (2-4 weeks), when a product is incrementally developed.
- Scum: A daily team meeting where progress is reviewed and work to be done that day.
- ScrumMaster: A team coach who guides the team in the effective use of Scum.
  - Not a project manager, but a coach ("You follow this process")
- Velocity: An estimate of how much work a team can do in a single sprint.
- Product Owner: Responsible for ensuring that the development team are always focused on the product they are building.
- Self-organising Teams: Make their own decisions and work by discussing issues and making decisions by consensus.

### 5. User Stories

- **Specifications**
  - Small: Should be able to fit on a card.
  - Concise: A list of requirements, simple, easy to understand.
    - Doesn't need all of the details
    - It's an idea
- **Template:**
  - As a [Role] - Who wants it?
  - I want [Function] -What is it
  - So that [Value] - Why I want it
- Epic Story: A user story that is too complicated, so it gets split up into multiple user stories.
- Testing: Should be testing available to understand when the test is done.
- E.G., As a user, I want a location map of all available scooters, so I know where the available scooters are.

### 6. Evaluating User Stories

- **Independent**
- **Negotiable**
  - Details can be changed, a user story should capture the idea, not the details.
- **Valuable**
  - Should have some utility for the consumer
- **Estimable**
  - Helps keep the size small
- **Small**
  - An idea that's two persons weeks of work
- **Testable**
  - When is it done. Need to test it to know when it's done.

### 7. Sprints

- **Timeboxed Sprints**
  - Duration of 1-4 weeks, development stops at the end of a sprint whether or not the work has been completed.
    - Then you think again, improve, etc.
  - During a sprint, the team works on the items from the product backlog.
  - Products are delivered in a series of sprints, each sprint delivers an increment to a product.
- Sprint Planning: Work out what's going to happen during the Sprint
- Sprint Execution: The team works to implement the Sprint backlog items that has been chosen.
- Sprint Reviewing: The work done in the sprint is reviewed by the team, and they reflect on what went well and what didn't.
- Scum: Review the Sprint, Sprint backlog, what's going on.

### 8. Agile Activities

- **Test automation:** As far as possible, product testing should be automated.
- **Continuous Integration:** As soon as changes are made, you try and integrate it with the app, good for testing and seeing if anything breaks.

### 9. Personas

- **User Understanding:** Understand the potential users and customers.
  - You can interview them, or use software to see what they're doing.
  - Put yourself in the mindset of the user
  - Develop stories from the users perspective
- **Feature Description**
  - What is the feature
  - What is the input, what is the output etc.

### 10. Scenarios

- A scenario on how users or a group of users will use your system.
- You learn user stories from these scenarios.
- Describes a situation where a user or group of users interacts with the system or product. It helps visualize how people will use the features and functions of the software.
- Feature Creep: When features are added without thinking about the feature. Does it add anything new?

## Examples

> [!example] User Story Template
> **As a** [Role] - Who wants it?
> **I want** [Function] - What is it
> **So that** [Value] - Why I want it
> 
> Example: As a user, I want a location map of all available scooters, so I know where the available scooters are.

> [!example] User Story Evaluation (INVEST)
> - **I**ndependent
> - **N**egotiable
> - **V**aluable
> - **E**stimable
> - **S**mall
> - **T**estable
