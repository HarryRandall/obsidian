## Overview

Introduction to DevOps covering continuous integration, continuous deployment, infrastructure as code, and monitoring practices.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. What Is DevOps

- **DevOps** unifies development and operations to enhance software delivery speed and quality.
- Benefits:
  - **Increased Velocity:** Faster product releases.
  - **Improved Quality:** Fewer bugs, more stability.
- Core principles: Automation of all repetitive tasks and shared responsibility across teams.

### 2. CI: Continuous Integration

- Continuous Integration (CI): Code changes are frequently integrated, built, and tested.
- Key Practices:
  - Commit often and test with each change to catch bugs early.
  - Avoid "breaking the build" by testing locally before pushing.
- Benefits: Faster bug detection, continuous feedback, and stable builds.

### 3. CD: Continuous Deployment

- Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatic release of validated builds to production.
- Benefits:
  - **Reduced risk** with smaller, frequent releases.
  - Faster **customer feedback** and ability to run A/B tests.
- Canary and Blue-Green Deployments: Staged releases to minimise user impact from potential issues.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manages and provisions infrastructure through code, ensuring consistency.
- Benefits:
  - **Visibility:** Configurations are documented and trackable.
  - **Reliability:** Reduces manual errors and enables environment reproducibility.
- Tools: Puppet, Ansible, and Terraform for automated, consistent deployment across servers.

### 5. Monitoring

- **Monitoring and Observability:** Collects real-time data to track system performance and detect issues.
- Dashboards provide insights into:
  - **Normal vs abnormal behaviour** to enable faster problem-solving.
  - Correlating metrics with changes to identify cause and effect.
- Essential for understanding system health and preventing downtime.
