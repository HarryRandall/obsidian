## Overview

Introduction to code inspection and review processes covering formal inspections, reviews, quality management in Agile, modern code reviews, pair and mob programming, and meeting management.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Inspection

- Inspections identify defects in code or documents early, without executing code.
- Roles in inspections: Author (explains work), Reader (leads through code), Moderator (manages meeting), Recorder (notes issues).
- Checklists for common errors enhance efficiency (e.g., initialisation, loop termination).
- Proved to find up to 90% of bugs, but can be time consuming and is best for critical code sections.

### 2. Reviews and Inspections

- **Reviews** assess software's progress, quality, or readiness, often leading to "sign-offs".
- **Inspection Phases:** Pre-review (prep), Review meeting, Post-review (follow-ups).
- **Types of Reviews:** Code reviews, design reviews, formal qualification reviews.
- Encourages a quality culture by fostering collaboration and feedback.

### 3. Quality Management in Agile

- Agile quality is maintained through a collaborative quality culture, not rigid documentation.
- **Key practices:** "Key before check-in", "Never break the build", "Fix issues on the spot".
- Informal reviews like Scrum (sprint reviews) and Extreme Programming (pair programming).

### 4. Modern Code Reviews

- Code reviews find defects, enforce standards, and promote knowledge sharing.
- Improves readability, removes dead code, and aligns team standards.
- Reviews support transparency and shared ownership, which reduces code defensiveness.
- Style guides (e.g., Google's) help enforce consistency across codebases.

### 5. Pair and Mob Programming

- **Pair Programming:** Driver (codes) and Navigator (reviews) work together, switching roles.
- **Mob Programming:** All team members work simultaneously on the same code, increasing collaboration and quality.
- Advantages: Faster knowledge sharing, reduce bugs, and increased morale.
- Challenges: Risk mutual misunderstandings and reluctance to critique closely working partners.

### 6. Running a Meeting

- **Key rules:** Set the agenda, start and end on time, conclude with an action plan.
- **Encourage participation** by giving everyone a role and setting ground rules.
- Managing personalities and encouraging constructive input are essential for effectiveness.
- Types of meetings (e.g., brainstorming, decision-making) require different best practice.
