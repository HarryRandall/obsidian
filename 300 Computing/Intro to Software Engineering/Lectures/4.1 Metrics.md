## Overview

Introduction to software metrics covering understanding large systems, case studies (Maintainability Index, Autonomous Vehicle Safety), measurement for decision making, data understanding, metrics and incentives, and Google's GSM framework.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Understanding Large Systems

- Large systems are complex and difficult to understand.
- Approaches include consulting documentation, experts, or using experience with patterns.
- Observation and hypothesis testing are essential for understanding interactions between components.

### 2. Case Study: The Maintainability Index

- Maintainability Index scores code from 0 to 100 to indicate ease of maintenance.
- Higher scores indicate better maintainability (green, yellow, and red ratings).
- Initially developed through statistical analysis, the metric simplifies complexity using Halstead Volume, Cyclomatic Complexity, and Lines of Code.

### 3. Case Study: Autonomous Vehicle Safety

- Quality and safety are assessed using metrics such as test coverage, model accuracy, failure rates, and milage.
- Metrics provide a quantitative basis for evaluating the performance of autonomous vehicle software.

### 4. Measurement for Decision Making

- Measurement assigns numbers based on models or theories to describe attributes, reducing uncertainty.
- Software quality metrics help in decision-making but must be carefully validated to ensure relevance and accuracy.

### 5. Understanding Your Data

- Effective data understanding involves verifying causation, avoiding cofounding variables, and ensuring validity (construct, internal, and external).
- Measurement reliability ensures consistency and reduces uncertainty through repeated testing.

### 6. Metrics and Incentives

- Metrics can influence behaviour (Good-hart's Law), with productivity incentives potentially leading to negative effects, such as reduced intrinsic motivation, or short-term focus.
- Examples include lines of code per day and number of bugs fixed.

### 7. Goals, Signals, Metrics

- Google's GSM framework defines goals (desired outcomes), signals (indicators of achievement), and metrics (measurable proxies for signals).
- The approach helps align metrics with high-level goals, even if direct measurement is not feasible.

## Formulas & Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Maintainability Index | Scores code from 0 to 100 to indicate ease of maintenance |
| Halstead Volume | A software metric used in the Maintainability Index |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | A software metric measuring the complexity of a program |
| Good-hart's Law | When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure |
| GSM Framework | Google's framework: Goals (desired outcomes), Signals (indicators of achievement), Metrics (measurable proxies) |
| Construct Validity | The extent to which a test measures what it claims to measure |
| Internal Validity | The extent to which a study establishes a trustworthy cause-and-effect relationship |
| External Validity | The extent to which results can be generalized to other situations |
