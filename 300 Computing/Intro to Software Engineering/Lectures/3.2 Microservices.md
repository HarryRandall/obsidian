## Overview

Introduction to microservices architecture covering monolithic vs service-oriented architectures, microservices characteristics, design examples, and RESTful services.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Monolithic vs Service-Oriented

- **Monolithic Architecture:** Single, unified codebase handling all aspects of an application; often less scalable and harder to modify without system-wide impact.
- **Service-Orientated Architecture (SOA):** Divides functionality into services with specific tasks; emphasises reusability and integration but can become complex.
- **Microservices**: An evolved SOA where services are smaller, independently deployable, and focused on single functionalities, enhancing scalability and flexibility.

### 2. Microservices

- **Characteristics**
  - **Single Responsibility:** Each microservice handles one business function.
  - **Independence:** Can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
  - **Data Management:** Each services often manages it's own data to avoid cross-service dependencies.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Scalability:** Only needed service scale, optimising resource use.
  - **Resilience:** Faults are isolated to individual services.
  - **Faster Development Cycles:** Teams can work on seperate services concurrently
- **Challenges**:
  - Complexity in deployment, managing distributed data, and inter-service communication.

### 3. Microservice Design Example

- Example: Authentication System with microservices for UID management, password management, user info management, and authentication.
- Each service perms specific tasks (e.g., UID service only manages user IDs) contributing to overall modularity and ease of maintenance.

### 4. RESTful Services

- Definition: REST (Representational State Transfer) enables stateless communication over HTTP, commonly used in microservices.
- **Principles**:
  - **Statelessness:** Each request from client to server must contain all information to understand and process the request.
  - **Uniform Interface:** Use standard HTTP verbs (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) for CRUD operations.
  - **Resource Identification:** Resources are addressable via URIs, making the system scaleable and easy to navigate
- Advantages:
  - Simple and lightweight, fitting well with microservices.
  - Enables integration with web-based applications and mobile devices effectively.
