## Overview

Coverage of team culture in software engineering including strong team culture principles, 10X engineers, team issues (social loafing, groupthink), modern team structures (feature teams, matrix organisation, autonomous squads), virtual teams, developer turnover and motivation, and documentation practices.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Overview

- Strong team culture emphasises trust, mutual respect, and collaborative goals.
- Encourages open communication and feedback, focusing on continuous improvement.
- Supports diverse perspectives, which enhance creativity and problem solving.

### 2. 10X Engineers

- Highly productive engineers can deliver up to 10 times the output of an average developer.
- Performance factors include coding speed, debugging efficiency and program size.
- Often work independently and require minimal management but may need integration with team efforts.

### 3. Teams and Team Issues

- **Social Loafing:** Some team members exert less effort in groups; mitigate by assigning clear roles and responsibilities.
- **Groupthink:** Suppression of dissenting views for harmony; prevent by promoting open discussions and diverse perspectives.
- **Multiple/Conflicting Goals:** Align team and individual goals to avoid clashes and maintain focus.

### 4. Modern Team Structures

- **Feature Teams:** Small, cross-functional teams with members covering different aspects (e.g., design, testing).
- **Matrix Organisation:** Employees assigned to different projects temporarily; flexibility but may lead to role conflicts.
- **Autonomous Squads:** Teams with high autonomy but aligned with organisational goals, common in agile environments.

### 5. Virtual Teams

- Virtual collaboration supported by tools (e.g., GitHub) **communication** and **engagement challenges**.
- Success requires **clear communication channels** and regular updates to maintain team cohesion and productivity.

### 6. General Guidelines

- Foster an environment of **trust** and **strategic autonomy**.
- Reduce bureaucracy, promote peer coaching, and avoid in-team competition.
- Ensure realistic deadlines and protect time for quality assurance.

### 7. Developer Turnover and Motivation

- **High turnover** leads to increased costs and productivity loss; mitigate by creating a positive culture with growth opportunities.
- Motivation theories stress the importance of addressing dissatisfaction while fostering autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
- Offering **learning opportunities**, flexible work conditions, and recognition helps retain talent.

### 8. Documentation

- Essential for code maintainability and team communication; optimise for the reader.
- Types include reference docs, design docs, and tutorials.
- Documentation should be version-controlled, have clear ownership, and undergo regular reviews to stay updated.

## Examples

> [!example] Team Issues
> - **Social Loafing:** Some team members do less work when working in a group
> - **Groupthink:** Team members suppress dissenting views to maintain harmony
> - **Conflicting Goals:** Individual goals conflict with team goals

> [!example] Modern Team Structures
> - **Feature Teams:** Small cross-functional teams (e.g., designer, developer, tester)
> - **Matrix Organisation:** Employees work on multiple projects
> - **Autonomous Squads:** High autonomy teams aligned with organisational goals
