## Overview

Introduction to the relational data model, covering the fundamental concepts of relations (tables), attributes (columns), and tuples (rows), and how they relate to the mathematical foundation of relational databases.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Relational Model Foundation

- A relational model for large shared data banks
- A database contains tables (called relations), and each is made up of columns and rows 
- Humans have used tables for centuries to keep track of data
- A 2 dimensional matrix

### 2. Relation Terminology

A table is an informal term for a 'relation'.
- The vertical columns are called 'attributes' 
- The horizontal rows are called 'tuples'.
