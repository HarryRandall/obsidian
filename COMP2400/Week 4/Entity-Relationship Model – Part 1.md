#### Data Design - Four Phases
- Requirement Collections and analysis
This is the process of collecting and analysing data requirements of the organisation so as to provide database solutions that fulfil business needs of the organisation. Compilation of data requirements include;
	- A description of data used or generated
	- Details of how data is to be used/generated
	- Any additional requirements for a new database system
- Conceptual Design
The process of constructing a conceptual data model that is
1. Modelled at a high-level of abstraction
2. Sufficiently simple and often graphical
3. Used to communicate the requirements of a database with nontechnical users
A conceptual data model is built using the information in users' requirements specification.
- Logical design
The process of constructing a logical data model (e.g., relational or object-oriented)
