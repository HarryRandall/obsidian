#### Business Strategy
- Developing and implementing a business strategy is key to deriving value from technology.
- Without customers, revenue, profit and value, you don't have a business.
- Understanding the intent of the business strategy helps us to identify areas where technology contributes the most.
- There are many tools and frameworks that help senior management develop and communicate their business strategy.

#### Business Model Canvas (BMC)
- Customer Segments
	- Who are you customers?
	- Different groups of people or organisations your business serves.
- Value Propositions
	- What value do you deliver?
	- Why customers choose you - your solution to their problem
- Channels
	- How do you reach customers?
	- Ways you deliver your value (i.e. online, stones, partners, etc).
- Customer Relations
	- How do you interact with customers
	- Personal support, automation, self service etc.
- Revenue Streams
	- How do you earn money?
	- Direct sales, subscriptions, licensing, etc.
- Key Resources
	- What do you need to deliver your value?
	- Physical, human, intellectual, and financial resources.
- Key Activities
	- What must you do to deliver your value
	- Core operations like manufacturing, development, marketing.
- Key partnerships
	- Who helps you succeed?
	- Suppliers, distributors, strategic alliances
- Cost Structure
	- What are your major costs?
	- Fixed and variable costs of running the business

#### Information Systems Strategy
- There's significant overlap of Business and IT Strategies.
- The objective of the IS Strategy is to articulate the current state of technology, describe the future state, and lay out the plan to move from current to future.
- The IT Strategy must:
	- Improve management's understanding of IS opportunities and limitations
	- Assess current performance
	- Identify capacity and human resource requirements
	- Clarify the level of investment required.
- The articulation of how technology will support the organisation is based on long, medium and tactical plans.
- Given the nature of technology and industries the long-term plan may only be 2-3 years in duration (or shorter).
- The IS Strategy focused internally on the capabilities of applications, severs, desktops, data storage, networks and connections to the outside world.
- Little consideration of business strategy alignment and the possibility that technology needed to dictate strategic direction.

#### Value of System Modelling
- We want to understand how organisations use information systems.
- We look at information systems from several different perspectives and ask questions like:
	- How does technology fit within the organisation? Is this understood within the organisation?
	- Is the organisation deriving business value from its technology?
	- Does technology align with the organisations business strategy?
	- How does technology support its operating environment
