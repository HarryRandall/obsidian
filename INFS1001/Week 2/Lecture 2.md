#### The Information Systems Strategy (What makes a good one)
- **Alignment** - clearly aligns with business strategy, key performance indicators and technology governance principles.
- **Realistic** - provides a realistic assessment of current capabilities and the ability of the organisation to absorb new technologies.
- **Clarity** - clearly explains the strategy in technical and non-technical terms.
- **Organisational change** - describes how organisational change will be managed by senior management and programs/projects.
- **Time based** - provides description of initiatives on a timeline throughout the planning horizon. Recognises that there are dependencies within the plan.
- **Financially sound** - provides realistic capital and operating budget estimates. Demonstrates Business value and ROI.
- **Innovation** - incorporates appropriate innovation that clearly drives business transformation.
- **Buy In** - likely to receive executive and senior management support in an environment where everyone is competing for capital.

#### Social Media Strategy
- Helps us to establish our personal brands as we post to friends, family, communities and, potentially, complete strangers.
- Emplyers use Social media to evaluate potential candidates and it should be assumed that the data you post on any site is going to be available forever.

#### Digital Strategy
- Organisations view and develop technology strategies from many different perspectives depending on the need.
- To drive value from technology there is often an overarching Information System strategy with linkages to "sub-strategies".
- Note that organisations develop strategies in many ways.
- In this course, we'll view Information Systems as an overarching strategy leading into Social Media and Digital Transormation.
- In practice, there's significant overlap however, it's useful to examine each individually so we understand the relevant components of each.
- This way, when combined, we make sure we haven't missed anything.

#### The Strategy Diamond
1. Arenas - where will we be active (e.g., online platforms, mobile apps)
2. Vehicles - How will we get there? (e.g., build in-house, partner with tech firms)
3. Differentiators - How will we win (e.g., superior UX, personalised services)
4. Staging - What will be our speed and sequence of moves?
5. Economic Logic - how will we make money or create value (e.g., reduce costs through automation, increase revenue via digital channels).
