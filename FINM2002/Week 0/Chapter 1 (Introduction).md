#### 1.1 Future Contracts
A futures contract is an agreement to purchase some asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price.

Futures exchanges help people buy or sell things at a set price for a future date. Imagine Alice in New York wants to buy a laptop in three months, and Bob in Kansas agrees to sell one at that time. They both enter into a contract through an exchange, agreeing on a price today (say $1,000). If more people want to buy laptops for future delivery, the price may go up; if more people want to sell, the price may go down. Alice now has a _long futures position_ (she's buying), and Bob has a _short futures position_ (he's selling). This futures price is different from the _spot price_, which is the price for buying a laptop right now.

Takeaways:
- Long futures position: When your buying something at some date
- Short futures position: When your selling something at some date
- Spot Price: The current of a laptop.
