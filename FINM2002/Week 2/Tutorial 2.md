### Question 5
This is a question from past exam.
The debt crisis of Evergrande and Australian iron ore industry.
China buys about 70% of the iron ore Australia exports, which in turn makes up about 60% of all the iron ore China imports. The real estate developments demand a large amount of steel, made from iron ore. Therefore a major default of Evergrande will hit the Australian iron ore exports. In fact, the iron ore price has declined from about $220 in the middle of 2021 to below $120 per tone in October. Assume you are the chief risk officer of an Australian iron ore company. You expect to sell 10 million tones of iron ore in 2022 February. You are concerned about the further price drop if Evergrande’s situation worsens. You decide to use the February-2022 forward contract on iron ore to hedge your exposure to the iron ore price drop. The delivery date is 3 months from now. The spot price of iron ore is $120 per tone; the 3-month risk free rate is 3% p.a.; the storage cost is 1% p.a. per tone. Both rates are continuously compounded. What position do you need to take in this forward contract, and what is the current price of this forward contract on 10 million tones of iron ore?
