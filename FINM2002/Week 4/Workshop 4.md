**Example**
- Strike price $X$ = $\$18$
- Expiration date in one year, $T$ = $1$
- Current price $c$ = $\$3$
- Stock price today $S_0$ = $\$20$
- $R_f$ = $10\%$ p.a. continuously compounded
- Calculate the theoretical minimum price for the option

Given $S_0 = 20$, $X = 18$, $r = 10\%$, $T=1$,$c=3$, the lower bound of the European call option is:
$$c_{min} = max(S_0-Xe^{-rT}, 0) = 20 - 18e^{-10\% \times 1} = \$3.71$$
- The current option price ($c = \$3$) is smaller than the lower bound
- Therefore arbitrage opportunity exists
- "Buy cheap and short expensive"
