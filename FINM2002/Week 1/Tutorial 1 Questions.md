### Question $1$  (1.09)
A stock when it is first issued provides funds for a company. Is the same true of an exchange-traded stock option? Please discuss.  

A stock when first issued gives the company funds in exchange for a portion of their company. An exchange traded stock is one of those shared on an exchange traded with a 3rd party. While the exchange traded funds don't directly provide funds for the company, if the share is shorted it could increase the price of the stocks indirectly increasing providing funds for the company.

### Question $2$  (1.10)
Explain why a futures contract can be used for either speculation or hedging.  

Because a future has two sides of the contract, one person who is speculating the risk and one person who is hedging their risk. Hedgers protect against price fluctuations (basically insuring their risk) and speculators use futures to try and profit from price movements.

### Question $3$  (1.11)
A cattle farmer expects to have $120,000$ of live cattle to sell in three months. The live-cattle futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is for the delivery of $40,000$ of cattle.  

- How can the farmer use the contract for hedging?  
$\frac{120000}{40000}$ = 3 contracts
- From the farmer’s viewpoint, what are the pros and cons of hedging?  
They are obliged to provide 3 contracts of $40,000$ cattle, so if they don't have all of the live cattle, they will have to buy cattle on their own accord to meet the contract. The pro's is that he doesn't need to worry about the price of live cattle plummeting down as he's already locked in the amount he is going to receive from them.

### Question $4$ (2.10)
Explain how margins protect investors against the possibility of default.  

Margins protect investors by ensuring they have enough funds to cover potential losses. Futures contracts are marked to market daily, and if losses exceed a threshold, a **margin call** requires additional funds. If an investor fails to meet this, their position is liquidated, preventing default.

### Question $5$  (2.12)
Show that if the futures price of a commodity is greater than the spot price during the delivery period, there is an arbitrage opportunity.

- Does an arbitrage opportunity exist if the futures price is less than the spot price?  
Yes
- Explain your answer.  
If the futures price is less than the spot price, that means that you are able to sell the asset currently for the spot price and enter into a futures contract at the futures price, therefore making money with little risk. Here is an example:

If gold’s spot price is **£2,000/oz**, but the **1-month futures price** is **£1,950/oz**, an arbitrageur can sell gold at the higher spot price and simultaneously enter a futures contract to buy it back at the lower price in one month. At maturity, they purchase gold for **£1,950/oz**, fulfilling the contract and locking in a **risk-free profit of £50/oz**. This arbitrage activity increases selling pressure in the spot market (pushing the spot price down) and increases buying in the futures market (pushing the futures price up) until the prices converge.

### Question $6$  (2.19)
“Speculation in futures markets is pure gambling. It is not in the public interest to allow speculators to trade on a futures exchange.”  

Discuss this viewpoint.  

This is not true at all, people can research and make educated decisions on futures products. Without speculators, there would be little futures contracts as those people hedging would find it hard to have their contracts filled.
