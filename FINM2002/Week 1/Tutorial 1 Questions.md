### Question $1$  (1.09)
A stock when it is first issued provides funds for a company. Is the same true of an exchange-traded stock option? Please discuss.  

A stock when first issued gives the company funds in exchange for a portion of their company. An exchange traded stock is one of those shared on an exchange traded with a 3rd party. While the exchange traded funds don't directly provide funds for the company, if the share is shorted it could icnrease the price of the stocks indirectly increasing providing funds for the company.

### Question $2$  (1.10)
Explain why a futures contract can be used for either speculation or hedging.  

Because a future has two sides of the contract, one person who is speculating the risk and one person who is hedging their risk. Hedgers protect against price fluctuations (basically insuring their risk) and speculators use futures to try and profit from price movements.

### Question $3$  (1.11)
A cattle farmer expects to have $120,000$ of live cattle to sell in three months. The live-cattle futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is for the delivery of $40,000$ of cattle.  

- How can the farmer use the contract for hedging?  
$\frac{120000}{40000}$ = 3 contracts
- From the farmer’s viewpoint, what are the pros and cons of hedging?  
They are obliged to provide 3 contracts of $40,000$ cattle, so if they don't have all of the live cattle, they will have to buy cattle on their own accord to meet the contract. The pro's is that he doesn't need to worry about the price of live cattle plummeting down as he's already locked in the amount he is going to receive from them.
